For my &#8220;Pedagogical Experience&#8221; requirement at Wheaton, I&#8217;m helping to teach a masters-level Christian Theology course.

Yesterday, I got to teach a lesson on justification and sanctification.Â  A lot to cover in a 95-minute class session!

If you&#8217;re interested in what I covered, here are my slides (in PDF format).
