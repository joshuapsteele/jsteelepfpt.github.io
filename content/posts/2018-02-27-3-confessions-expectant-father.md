## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Were_Expecting"></span>We&#8217;re Expecting!<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

In case you haven&#8217;t heard the news, my wife Rachel and I are expecting our firstborn child this August! Rachel is currently 16 weeks along, and we won&#8217;t find out the gender of the baby (whom I am affectionately calling &#8220;Lump&#8221;) for another month.

  * She works full-time as a Family Nurse Practitioner.
  * I&#8217;m a full-time Ph.D. student.
  * We&#8217;re both actively involved in our church.
  * Etc. etc.

  * I&#8217;ve got a dissertation proposal to defend.
  * We&#8217;ll be traveling for our siblings&#8217; high school graduation.
  * (Lord-willing and baby-waiting) we&#8217;ll both be in my sister-in-law&#8217;s wedding this Summer (I&#8217;m the officiant).

And then? Then Lump makes his or her appearance!

Anyways, this might be a bit self-serving, but amidst all the busyness, I thought I&#8217;d take a few minutes to write down some of my thoughts and feelings as I await the birth of my firstborn child.

(I&#8217;ve been inspired to do this by reading the extremely helpful _<a href="http://amzn.to/2F0eMQv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Expectant Father: The Ultimate Guide for Dads-to-Be</a> _[affiliate link]. I highly recommend it to you if it&#8217;s relevant to your situation!)

OK, here goes:

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="1_Im_Anxious_and_Stressed"></span>1. I&#8217;m Anxious and Stressed<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

I&#8217;m not necessarily putting this first because I feel it the strongest/most, but rather because I&#8217;m the most embarrassed by it!

I&#8217;m anxious and stressed when it comes to my future as a parent, largely because the future has an annoying tendency to remain unknown! As a perfectionist &#8211; as a 1 on the Enneagram (check out _<a href="http://amzn.to/2BTmugK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Road Back to You</a> _[affiliate link] if you don&#8217;t know what that means) &#8211; I don&#8217;t like such uncertainty.

  * What if there are health complications with the pregnancy, delivery, or the baby?
  * How will we navigate all of the complexities of parenting?
  * What will our new schedule/life look like?
  * How will we deal with the sleep deprivation?!

Furthermore, something that&#8217;s weighing particularly heavy on me right now is: **How will I provide for my family?**

Rachel&#8217;s been earning the lion&#8217;s share of our income for the duration of our marriage, first as a Registered Nurse and now as a Family Nurse Practitioner. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s a bad thing, by the way. She&#8217;s crazy good at what she does, and her earning potential as an RN and FNP has been quite higher than mine as a seminarian and now a Ph.D. student!

However, with a baby on the way, we&#8217;d like for Rachel to be able to stay at home as much as she would like to as soon as possible after the baby&#8217;s born. And, as a Ph.D. student who wants to become a pastor-theologian (check out <a href="http://amzn.to/2F9xCbu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Pastor Theologian</em></a> [affiliate link] if you don&#8217;t know what that means), my earning potential isn&#8217;t exactly skyrocketing right now.

This is forcing me to get creative and try to come up with ideas for an extra source(s) of income (&#8220;side hustles,&#8221; as they&#8217;re called &#8211; check out _<a href="http://amzn.to/2ovTvbe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days</a> _[affiliate link] to learn more). However, getting creative is hard work, of course!

Anyways, there&#8217;s just a glimpse of my stress/anxiety.

Thankfully, that&#8217;s not all that&#8217;s on my mind and heart!

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="2_Im_Thankful_and_Grateful"></span>2. I&#8217;m Thankful and Grateful<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

First and foremost, I&#8217;m grateful to **God** for providing the gift of a new life and entrusting it to our care.

Second, I&#8217;m thankful for my **wife**. Rachel is amazing. She&#8217;s going to be a fantastic mother, and there&#8217;s no one else I&#8217;d rather be a parent alongside!

However, I have also experienced a recent spike in gratitude for my **parents**. It&#8217;s crazy to think that, about 27 years ago, my parents were in the exact same situation, and _I_ was the firstborn child on the way, about to change their lives forever!

27 years later, and I&#8217;ve been the recipient of countless acts of selfless love and generosity from Patrick and Donna Steele. I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for such loving and God-fearing parents (to say nothing of my loving and God-fearing in-laws!). I hope to pay the parenting gift forward, as it were, to the next generation.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="3_Im_Pumped_and_Excited"></span>3. I&#8217;m Pumped and Excited<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Yes, I&#8217;m anxious. Sure, I&#8217;m grateful. But I&#8217;m also pumped! I&#8217;m excited to be a dad!

Rachel and I have always loved children. In fact, I&#8217;ve developed a reputation as &#8220;The Baby Whisperer&#8221; in recent years (we&#8217;ll see how long that lasts).

Now, we get to raise a child of our own!

Will we desperately need the Lord&#8217;s help at every step of the way? You bet!

Thankfully, we serve a God who is ready and willing to provide such help!
