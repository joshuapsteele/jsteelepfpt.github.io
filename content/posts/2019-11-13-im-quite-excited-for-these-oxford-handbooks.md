If you&#8217;ve not yet consulted the Oxford Handbook series, you should! [The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology][1] is especially useful!

I&#8217;m very excited because [the Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer][2] and [the Oxford Handbook of Karl Barth][3] are both about to be released soon!

I just wish they weren&#8217;t so expensive!
