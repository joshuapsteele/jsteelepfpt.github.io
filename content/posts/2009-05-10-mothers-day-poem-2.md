The following is an original Mother&#8217;s Day poem of mine, that I wrote for my mom (the best mom ever, of course) back in 2009. It&#8217;s called &#8220;From a Grateful Son,&#8221; and I hope that you enjoy it.

## From a Grateful Son &#8211; A Poem for My Mother

Thank you, Mom, for having me  
that day so long ago.  
Thank you, then, for holding me  
and now for letting go.  
Thank you, Mom, for giving me  
your patience, time, and care.  
And thank you, Mom, for loving me  
for always being there ‚Äì

Thanks so much for teaching me  
both how to read and write.  
For every single grueling day  
and every sleepless night.  
Thank you, Mom, for aiming high,  
for helping me succeed.  
For never letting me forget  
that you believe in me.

Mom, you mean so much to me.  
My words cannot convey  
The debt of love, of care-filled work  
That I should rightly pay.  
Though distance, time, and life itself  
may take me far away,  
I&#8217;ll always be your little boy  
with these three words to say ‚Äì

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù
