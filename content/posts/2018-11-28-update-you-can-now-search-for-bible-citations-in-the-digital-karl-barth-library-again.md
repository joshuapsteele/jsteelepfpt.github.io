I [recently wrote][1] about a problem I found in [Alexander Street Press&#8217;][2] [Digital Karl Barth Library][3]: the Scripture citation search function no longer worked!

I&#8217;m happy to report that, though the DKBL is still far from user-friendly, the Bible search _works_ again!

Now we just need some angel investors and programmers to produce a user-friendly version of the Digital Karl Barth Library! ðŸ™‚ Any takers?
