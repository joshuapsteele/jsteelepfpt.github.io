I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, <a href="http://theohhellos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oh Hellos</a>, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.

I love all of The Oh Hellos&#8217; music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called &#8220;The Truth is a Cave,&#8221; and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I&#8217;m calling &#8220;the theological journey&#8221; &#8211; the stages one goes through in one&#8217;s knowledge of God.

Here&#8217;s a video. Give the song a listen.



Here are the lyrics:

> I was young and naive  
> As I was told, so I believed  
> And I was told there&#8217;s only one road that leads you home
> 
> And the truth was a cave on the mountainside  
> And I&#8217;d seek it out until the day I died
> 
> I was bound and determined  
> To be the child that you wanted  
> But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find
> 
> And the truth became a tool that I held in my hand  
> I wielded it, but I didn&#8217;t understand
> 
> I got tired of giving more than you gave to me  
> And I desired a truth I wouldn&#8217;t have to seek
> 
> But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me

ˆThere&#8217;s my summary of the song&#8217;s message in a nutshell.

Verse one portrays the truth as a distant and unattainable cave. I think that&#8217;s where we all start off in our theological journeys. The danger at this beginning stage is that God feels very distant and aloof. If we&#8217;re not careful, we can tire out and despair while &#8220;seeking out [the truth] until the day [we] die.&#8221;

However, things don&#8217;t get any better in verse two, where the truth is a tool. We, especially formal students of theology like myself, can quickly get caught up in our zeal for theological truth (&#8220;I was bound and determined / To be the child that you wanted&#8221;), missing the ways in which God actually wants to speak to us (&#8220;But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find&#8221;).

The result? We act like the truth about God is something we can possess and use to our own advantage. We treat theology like a swordfight or a dojo.

This gets us to verse three, the stage of the burnt-out theologian: &#8220;I got tired of giving more than you gave to me. And I desired a truth I wouldn&#8217;t have to seek.&#8221;

I could pretend like I don&#8217;t know why those words often bring tears to my eyes, but I do.

Pour your heart, mind, and soul into the theological task &#8211; as if it all depends on you and your zealous efforts to plumb the depths of the divine mysteries &#8211; and you will be brought to anger and/or despair by a world that so often feels godless, if not god-forsaken.

Good news, though: It doesn&#8217;t all depend on you and your theological efforts. God reveals himself to us, even (especially) when we least expect it: &#8220;But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me.&#8221;

Good news: The truth isn&#8217;t a cave.

The truth isn&#8217;t a tool.

The truth is a Person. Have you met the Truth?
