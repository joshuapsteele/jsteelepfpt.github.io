  Because good writing = good thinking, I believe that <i>everyone </i>could benefit from developing the habit of regular writing.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  However, because I

  * Am a Ph.D. student about to begin work on his dissertation
  * Edit a blog (<a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rookie Anglican</a>)
  * Write this personal blog

<p class="p3">
  I <i>really </i>need to develop the habit of regular writing.
</p>

<p class="p3">
  Up until now, I’ve largely relied upon writing in fits and starts, when the Muse descends, as it were.
</p>

<p class="p3">
  This, however, is not good enough (as Stephen Pressfield forcefully says in his book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2DDHfu7"><i>The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles</i></a>). It won’t get my dissertation written, nor will it help me stay on top of two different blogs!
</p>

<p class="p3">
  What’s the solution? A regular writing habit, day in and day out.

  There are plenty of guides out there on the internet about the process of habit formation. Here are a few:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">
    <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">The Habits Guide: How to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones </a>[James Clear]
  </li>
  <li class="li3">
    <a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them">Habits: How They Form and How to Break Them</a> [NPR]
  </li>
  <li class="li3">
    <a href="https://zenhabits.net/habitses/">The Four Habits that Form Habits</a> [Zen Habits]
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p3">
  Furthermore, there are two excellent books on habit formation that I highly recommend:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">
    <a href="http://amzn.to/2HHVT5Z"><i>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</i></a> by Charles Duhigg

</ul>

<p class="p3">
  If you look through those resources, you’ll notice a particular model that appears again and again. A habit boils down to three things (this version of the framework mainly comes from Charles Duhigg’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2pkxfBO"><i>The Power of Habit</i></a><i>. </i>You can read the appendix of the book for free <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">here</a>.) :
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">
    <b>TRIGGER</b>: The cue or reminder that prompts the behavior. Frequently, cues involve <ul class="ul2">
      <li class="li3">
        Time
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Location
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        People (who are you with?)
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Preceding Action (what did you just do?)
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Emotion
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li class="li3">
    <b>BEHAVIOR</b>: The behavior itself, whether something good for you, like writing 500 words every day, or something bad for you, like smoking a pack of cigarettes.
  </li>
  <li class="li3">
    <b>REWARD</b>: The benefit you get from the behavior.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">
    Isolate the consistent TRIGGER. When you feel the craving to do the thing you’re trying to stop doing, ask yourself: <ul class="ul2">
      <li class="li3">
        What time is it?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Where are you?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Who else is around?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        What did you just do?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        What emotion are you feeling?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li class="li3">
    Isolate the consistent REWARD. What benefit/craving is this habit providing/satisfying? Come up with an idea and test the theory by substituting different rewards until you find something that makes the craving goes away. This is what you’re really craving as a result of the behavior.
  </li>
  <li class="li3">
    Insert a new BEHAVIOR between the trigger and the reward. <ul class="ul2">
      <li class="li3">
        Choose a new activity that is triggered by the old trigger and provides the old reward.
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Write this commitment down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [do the new BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].”
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Follow through on your plan!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">
    Come up with a TRIGGER: <ul class="ul2">
      <li class="li3">
        Time?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Location?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        People around?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Immediately preceding action?
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Emotion?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li class="li3">
    Come up with a REWARD for after the behavior: <ul class="ul2">
      <li class="li3">
        Make sure you actually enjoy it!
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Make sure that you crave this reward when exposed to the trigger from the previous step!
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Ideally, you will eventually desire the habit for its intrinsic reward. That’s what you’re shooting for.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li class="li3">
    Insert the BEHAVIOR into a routine: <ul class="ul2">
      <li class="li3">
        Write it down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [perform desired BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].”
      </li>
      <li class="li3">
        Follow through on your plan!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p3">
  In theory, it’s pretty simple, actually. We just need to take the previous outline, for how to develop a new habit, and apply it to the specific behavior of writing consistently. 500 words a day is a great goal, and it’s the one I’ll be using.
</p>

<p class="p3">
  First, however, we need a TRIGGER. For me, the trigger I’m going to try out for the next few days is “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else…”
</p>

<p class="p3">
  The REWARD I’m going to experiment with is: “…I will go for a 20-minute walk outside.”
</p>

<p class="p3">
  Put together, my commitment looks like: “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else, I will write 500 words, because then I get to go for a 20-minute walk outside.”
