Last night, the scale read 192.4. I&#8217;d really like it to read 180 or less.

So, in lieu of how effective [putting money on the line via StickK][1] has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I&#8217;ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.

For my writing habit, I&#8217;ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I&#8217;m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I&#8217;m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)

For my Slow Carb Diet commitment, I&#8217;m going to keep the diet 6 days a week for 4 weeks. For every week I&#8217;m unsuccessful, $35 will go to NARAL Pro Choice America. (I&#8217;m pro-life. I think abortion is a tragedy.)

If there&#8217;s a habit that you&#8217;d like to develop or quit, I highly recommend giving [StickK][1] a try! Fear of losing money to an organization you hate is a powerful motivator!

And if you&#8217;d like to lose fat/weight, I highly recommend the [Slow Carb Diet][2].

It&#8217;s built around 5 simple rules.

> Rule #1: Avoid “white” starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains. If you have to ask, don’t eat it.
> 
> Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You already do this; you’re just picking new default meals.
> 
> Rule #3: Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1-2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed.
> 
> Rule #4: Don’t eat fruit. (Fructose –> glycerol phosphate –> more bodyfat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are excepted.
> 
> Rule #5: Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday. 

There&#8217;s a [pretty active sub-Reddit devoted to the Slow Carb Diet][3] if you&#8217;d like more information.

Cheers!
