Registration now open for the missional gathering for leaders at the intersection of gospel and culture.

At the 2019 Intersection Conference (May 16-18 at Trinity Anglican Church in Atlanta), the theme is “For the Sake of the World: An Anglican Missional Ecclesiology.” Anglican leaders will engage 8 leading evangelical and sacramental voices exploring what it means to be the church on mission. Through panels and cohorts, attendees will gain actionable ideas and practices to catalyze their local churches to engage contemporary culture.

After each speaker, a panel of diverse thinkers will interact with the concepts, interweaving approaches to Anglican practice and perspective. Attendees will then discuss practical implications in mealtime cohort groups—leaving challenged and energized for mission in a post-Christian world.

This year there is no application process. All attendees are welcome.

Speakers:

  * Hans Boersma
  * Tish Harrison Warren
  * Esau McCaulley
  * David Fitch
  * William Cavanaugh
  * Winfield Bevins
  * Bishop Ric Thorpe
  * Bishop Todd Hunter

Both the 2017 and the 2018 Intersection Conferences were an exciting display of unity in the Anglican Church in North America—over 20 dioceses were represented at each! The 2019 conference will once again gather missional minds from around the province to crack the code for 21st century mission. Hosting the conference is The Telos Collective, a five-year initiative commissioned by Archbishop Foley Beach to catalyze faithful and fruitful Gospel engagement with culture. Archbishop Beach asked Bishop Todd Hunter to lead The Telos Collective, working alongside him and other bishops and leaders to help the Anglican Church gain confidence to engage a postmodern world.

“We’re looking for men and women who think like missionaries, who are committed to using every strategy at their disposal to reach 21st century North Americans for Christ,” Archbishop Beach says.

Bishop Hunter believes the Intersection Conference is an important way to serve Provincial Sponsor Archbishop Beach and the Anglican Church in North America. “We respect the diversity of the dioceses within, and focus our energy in one specific direction: mission,” he says. “We will encourage attendees to think about and execute these ideas within their bishops’ overall ecclesiology and under their leadership.”
