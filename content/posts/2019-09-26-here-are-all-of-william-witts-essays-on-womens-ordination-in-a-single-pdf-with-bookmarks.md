Over on his blog, &#8220;Non Sermoni Res,&#8221; Dr. [William Witt has written several excellent essays on the topic of women&#8217;s ordination][1].

Here&#8217;s [the guide that Witt put together in order to orient readers to his essays][2].

What I&#8217;ve done is to combine the blog posts into a single PDF, with bookmarks. Here it is:
