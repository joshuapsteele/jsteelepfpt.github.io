</p>

Our goal is to assist <a href="http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Stone families</a> (Dave & Evelyn; Jonathan & Angela) in their various local ministries, including:

  * [Seminario Teológico Bautista][1] (Seminary)
  * [Luz del Camino Iglesia][2] (Church)
  * [Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal][3] (Pregnancy Center)

The goal of Beeson&#8217;s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to &#8220;_expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting_.&#8221; In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be **influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions**. God&#8217;s given each of us unique gifts &#8212; ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But **He&#8217;s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church**.

Frankly, we realize that **we have much more to learn than to offer! But we&#8217;re excited to learn valuable lessons in Lima. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Would you please pray for us as we prepare for this trip?</span> **

Finally, if you&#8217;re interested in partnering with us financially to make this trip a reality, please visit [our YouCaring.Com page. ][4]

Grace and Peace,

~Josh
