  * [Snakes and Ladders – by Alan Jacobs][3]
  * [Farnam Street — A Collection of Signal in a World Full of Noise.][4]
  * [Seth’s Blog][5]
  * [Study Hacks &#8211; Decoding Patterns of Success &#8211; Cal Newport][6]
  * [James Clear][7]
  * [Barking Up The Wrong Tree &#8211; How to be awesome at life.][8]
  * [The Appademic » Technology, productivity and workflows for academics, students and other nerds][9]
  * [McSweeney’s Internet Tendency][10]

What are you reading?

If you haven’t given RSS readers a try, then [Feedly][12] is a good first RSS reader to try.
