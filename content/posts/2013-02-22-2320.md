This is ridiculous and dangerous. For shame, Mr. Scharnberg and Dr. Gredy.

How dare you try and accomplish this (already concerning) return to fundamentalism in an unethical manner! How dare you sacrifice good men and their families on the altar of your own agenda, and then proceed to bathe your actions in lies!
