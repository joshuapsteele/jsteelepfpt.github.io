The &#8220;Occasional Prayers&#8221; section of the Book of Common Prayer is a goldmine, particularly when the going gets tough. 

The following prayers come from [the Anglican Church in North America&#8217;s 2019 Book of Common Prayer][1]. You can [view the text of the 2019 BCP here][2]. And you can [download a Word document containing all of the Occasional Prayers here][3].

    O merciful Father, you have taught us in your holy Word that you do not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men: Look with pity on the sorrows of your servant <em>N</em>. Remember <em>him</em>, O Lord, in mercy; nourish <em>his</em> soul with patience; comfort <em>him</em> with a sense of your goodness; lift up your countenance upon <em>him</em>; and give <em>him</em> peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong> Amen.</strong>

    O God, almighty and merciful, you heal the broken-hearted, and turn the sadness of the sorrowful to joy, Let your fatherly goodness be upon all whom you have made. Remember in pity all those who are this day destitute, homeless, elderly, infirm, or forgotten. Bless the multitude of your poor. Lift up those who are cast down. Mightily befriend innocent sufferers, and sanctify to them the endurance of their wrongs. Cheer with hope all who are discouraged and downcast, and by your heavenly grace preserve from falling those whose poverty tempts them to sin. Though they be troubled on every side, suffer them not to be distressed; though they are perplexed, save them from despair. Grant this, O Lord, for the love of him who for our sakes became poor, your Son our Savior Jesus Christ. <strong> Amen.</strong>
