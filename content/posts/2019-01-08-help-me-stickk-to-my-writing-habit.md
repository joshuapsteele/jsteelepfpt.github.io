I need to finish [this dissertation][1].

To do so, I need to write regularly. For me, that means writing every dayâ€”a minimum of 500 words every day.

Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I&#8217;ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it&#8217;s been a bear to get back on!

So, I&#8217;ve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.

If I don&#8217;t write 500 words related to my dissertation every day, StickK will donate $35 dollars every week I fail to the NRA.

_(I do not like the NRA.)_

I&#8217;m giving this a try for 8 weeks. If it works well, I&#8217;ll continue the commitment via StickK!

If you&#8217;d like to support me and keep track of my progress on StickK, you can do so by clicking [here][2].

If you have a habit you&#8217;d like to stick to, give StickK a try!
