This upcoming semester, I&#8217;ll be taking a seminar on the Doctrine of Creation from my supervisor Marc Cortez. I&#8217;ll also be doing my &#8220;pedagogical experience&#8221; in a Christian Theology course—also with Marc Cortez.

Anyways, in case you&#8217;re interested, I thought I&#8217;d share what I&#8217;ll be reading for each course.

Have you read any of these works? If so, what did you think? What will _you_ be reading this semester?
