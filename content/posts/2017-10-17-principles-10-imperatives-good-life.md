Why write out a list of principles?

For one thing, it&#8217;s my birthday. And, although I&#8217;m only in my twenties, I&#8217;m feeling a bit reflective.

For another, I&#8217;ve just been given a copy of _[Principles: Life and Work][1]_ [by Ray Dalio][1] (affiliate link).

According to Dalio (ix),

> Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be aplied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.

With that in mind, here are 10 principles I&#8217;ve developed so far. I&#8217;ve followed Dalio&#8217;s lead in casting my principles as imperatives. No, I don&#8217;t always do an excellent job at these. But they&#8217;re worth striving for.

No, this is not an exhaustive list. And no, I don&#8217;t always do an excellent job at these. But they&#8217;re worth striving for.

# 1. Go to Church: Word & Sacraments

This principle, and the following one, are purposefully at the top of the list. Why? Because they will place you in a context where your desires, your view of reality, and therefore your principles will be formed in the right direction.

So, go to a church where you can hear the Word of God preached and where you can partake of the Sacraments.

  * [Rookie Anglican&#8217;s Daily Office Booklet][6]
  * [The Daily Office from Mission St. Clare][7]
  * [The Daily Office from The Trinity Mission][8]

NOTE: I realize that a WHOLE LOT MORE could be said with/underneath these first two &#8220;principles.&#8221; As an overarching principle, _**&#8220;Become More Like Jesus Christ in All I Think, Feel, Say, and Do,&#8221;**_ is quite good. In fact, I&#8217;d consider most of the rest of this blog to be relevant in that respect.

However, I&#8217;m going to devote the next eight principles to various pragmatic concerns, such as productivity, physical fitness, and financial well-being.
