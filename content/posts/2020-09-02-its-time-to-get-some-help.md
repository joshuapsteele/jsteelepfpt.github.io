Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I&#8217;ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.

Sure, I&#8217;ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn&#8217;t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and _trapped_ often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.

I know, I know. That&#8217;s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!

However, as I see it, I&#8217;m writing it out here for two reasons:

  1. **To commit publicly to seeking out counseling** now that I&#8217;ve started my first try of medication.
  2. **In case anyone else out there**, currently experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., **needs a nudge to seek out help sooner rather than later**.

If #2 above refers to you, please know that you&#8217;re not alone! Please don&#8217;t let pride or anything else get in the way of receiving the help that you need.
