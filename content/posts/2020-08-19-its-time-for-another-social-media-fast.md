After listening to [the Blinkist summary of Cal Newport’s _Deep Work_][1] (I’ve read the book, this was just for a refresher), I’m convinced that it’s time for another 30-day fast from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. 

I think I’ll still keep [my micro.blog up and running][2], but between [running Anglican Compass][3] and [sprinting for some last-ditch clarity on my increasingly frustrating dissertation][4], I need all the extra bandwidth I can get!

If you need to get in touch for some reason, please [use the contact form on my website][5]. You can also [sign up for my very occasional email newsletter here][6].

One last thing: If you haven’t read [Cal Newport’s _Deep Work_][7] yet, you should do so ASAP!
