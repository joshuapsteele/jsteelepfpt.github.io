## Many Christians today are taking a closer at monasticism as a potential source for ecclesial renewal.

From the so-called New Monasticism movement of the past few decades to the more recent Benedict Option, monasticism has proven to be fertile ground for imagining new ways of faithful Christian living.

In the Anglican tradition, [this is not all that new or surprising][1]. Many Anglicans have found, and continue to find, a deep concordance with the spirituality and communal practices of monastic life.

However, in monasticisms both new and old, there tends to be an assumption that monastic practices are something _extra_—something for the spiritual elite, the more ardently devoted. Monasticism, while obviously related to the church, is _beyond_ the church.

But what if monastic life was supposed to be more deeply connected to the life of the church? What if monkhood, as Greg Peters says, is [for all believers][2]?

I think it is. And that’s why I’m excited to announce an upcoming conference: “[Catechesis as Monasticism: Cultivating Single-Minded Devotion in a Fragmented Age,][3]” featuring Greg Peters and Gerald Sittser. Both Greg and Jerry have written and taught extensively on monasticism, and both share a passion for helping the church today learn from the wisdom of the past.

## The [Rev. Dr. Greg Peters][4] is

  * an associate professor at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University,
  * a visiting professor of Monastic Studies at Nashotah House, and
  * an ordained Anglican priest and Benedictine oblate.

He is a scholar of the history of monasticism and ascetical theology, about which he has published several books, including [_The Monkhood of All Believers_][2]_: The Monastic Foundation of Christian Spirituality_ (Baker Academic, 2018) and [_The Story of Monasticism_][5]_: Retrieving an Ancient Tradition for Contemporary Spirituality_ (Baker Academic, 2015).

## [Dr. Gerald (“Jerry”) Sittser][6] is

  * Professor of Theology and Senior Fellow in the Office of Church Engagement at Whitworth University in Spokane, WA.
  * He researches and teaches the history of monasticism, Christian spirituality, and Religion in American Public Life, and is
  * the author of eight books, including [_A Grace Disguised_][7]_: How the Soul Grows Through Loss_ (Zondervan, 1996) and [_Water from a Deep Well_][8]_: Christian Spirituality from Early Martyrs to Modern Missionaries_ (IVP, 2007).

Jerry’s most recent book—a must-read book for anyone interested in how the early church can foster faithful witness today—is [_Resilient Faith: How the Early Christian “Third Way” Changed the World_][9] (Brazos, 2019). In this book, Jerry shows how the early Christian catechumenate provided a “bridge” from the pagan world to the Christian world, allowing Christians to be both _in_ the world—that is, not retreating from it—while also remaining distinctively _Christian_ in doing so.

## What both Greg and Jerry help us see is that catechesis and monasticism have much in common.

On the one hand, as Jerry suggests, the basic structures of the early Christian catechumenate are a lot like the structures of monastic formation—both aim for the [transformation of belief, belonging, and behavior][10].

On the other hand, as Greg argues, the rite of baptism makes _all_ Christians monks—because a monk is not just someone who is single or celibate but someone who is single-mindedly devoted to God.

If baptism makes Christians monks, then, what can we learn from the monastic tradition about catechesis? What can we glean from the wisdom of the desert that will enable our catechesis to foster Christians who, in our fragmented age, are single-minded in their devotion to Christ?

We’ll hear two presentations each from Greg and Jerry, with responses from our “working pastors”— [Fr. Lee Nelson][11] of Christ Church Waco, and [Fr. Ryan and Elizabeth Jones][12], both of [Eucharist Church][13], where the conference will take place. They will begin for us conversations about how Jerry and Greg’s teaching can bear fruit in the context of the local church.

In fact, this is something that the good folks at Eucharist Church have already begun by implementing what they call [“the Catechumenate”][14]—largely inspired from Jerry’s writing on catechesis.



There will also be plenty of time for Q&A, conversations, and camaraderie. We’ll do morning, midday, and evening prayer. Light breakfast and lunch on Saturday are included.

## Find out more information [here][3].

Or go ahead and register [here][15]!

Early registration (before Dec. 15) is $125 ($95 for students/pastors/retirees), and $150 after Dec. 15 ($125 for students/pastors/retirees). But do not let cost be prohibitive. Scholarships are available on a limited basis; direct inquiries [here][16].

I hope that you’ll join us in San Francisco on February 7-8. Please also consider sharing this event with those in your churches, schools, and networks who might find this helpful.
