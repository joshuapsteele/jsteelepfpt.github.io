  * X contradicts herself /can’t have it both ways. On the one hand, she argues $$$, but on the other hand, she also says $$$
  * By focusing on $$$, X overlooks the deeper problem of $$$
  * X claims $$$, but we don’t need X to tell us that. Anyone familiar with $$$ has long know that $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Agreeing_with_a_Difference"></span>**Agreeing, with a Difference**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * I agree that $$$ because my experience confirms it.
  * X surely is right about $$$ because, as she may not be aware, recent studies have shown that $$$.
  * X’s theory of $$$ is extremely useful because it sheds insight on the difficult problem of $$$
  * I agree that $$$, a point that needs emphasizing since so many people believe $$$
  * Those unfamiliar with this school of thought may be interested to know that it basically boils down to $$$
  * If group X is right that $$$, as I think they are, then we need to reassess the popular assumption that $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Agreeing_and_Disagreeing_Simultaneously"></span>**Agreeing and Disagreeing Simultaneously**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * Although I agree with X up to a point, I cannot accept his overall conclusion that $$$
  * Although I disagree with much that X says, I fully endorse his final conclusion that $$$
  * Though I concede that $$$, I still insist that $$$

  * I’m of two minds about X’s claim that $$$. On the one hand, I agree that $$$. On the other hand, I’m not sure if $$$

  * X argues $$$
  * According to both X and Y, $$$
  * Politicians $$$, X argues, should $$$
  * Most athletes will tell you that $$$
  * My own view, however, is that $$$
  * I agree, as X may not realize, that $$$, but $$$ are real and, arguably, the most significant factor in $$$

  * However, it is simply not true that $$$
  * Indeed, it is highly likely that $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Entertaining_Objections"></span>**Entertaining Objections**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * At this point, I would like to raise some objections that have been inspired by the skeptic in me. She feels that I have been ignoring $$$., “$$$,” she says to me, “$$$.”
  * Thus far some readers may challenge the view that $$$. After all, many believe $$$. Indeed, my own argument that $$$ seems to ignore $$$ and $$$
  * Of course, many will probably disagree with the assertion that $$$

**Naming Your Nay Sayers**

  * Here many $$$ would probably object that $$$
  * However/But $$$ would certainly take issue with the argument that $$$
  * $$$, of course, may want to question whether/dispute my claim that $$$
  * Nevertheless, both followers and critics of $$$ will probably argue that $$$
  * Although not all $$$ think alike, some of them will probably dispute my claim that $$$
  * $$$ are so diverse in their views that it’s hard to generalize about them, but some are likely to object on the grounds that $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introducing_Objections_Informally"></span>**Introducing Objections Informally**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * However/But is my proposal realistic? What are the chances of its actually being adopted?
  * Yet is it always true that $$$? Is it always the case, as I have been suggesting, that $$$?
  * However, does the evidence cited prove conclusively that $$$?
  * “Impossible,” some will say. “You must be reading the research selectively.”

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Making_Concessions_while_Still_Standing_Your_Ground"></span>**Making Concessions while Still Standing Your Ground**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * Although I grant that $$$, I still maintain that $$$
  * Proponents of X are right to argue that $$$. But they exaggerate when they claim that $$$
  * While it is true that $$$, it does not necessarily follow that $$$
  * On the one hand, I agree with X that $$$. But on the other hand, I still insist that $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Indicating_Who_Cares"></span>**Indicating Who Cares**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * $$$ used to think $$$, but recently (or within the past few decades) $$$ suggests that $$$
  * What his new research does, then, is correct the mistaken impression, held by many earlier researchers, that $$$
  * These findings challenge the work of earlier researchers, who tended to assume that $$$
  * Recent studies like these shed new light on $$$, which previous studies had not addressed.
  * Researchers have long assumed that $$$. For instance, one eminent scholar of cell biology, $$$ assumed in $$$, her seminal work on cell structures and functions, that fate cells $$$. As $$$ herself put it, “$$$.” Another leading scientist, $$$, argued that fat cells “$$$.” Ultimately, when it came to the nature of fat, the basic assumption was that $$$. But a new body of research shows that fat cells are far more complex and that $$$
  * If sports enthusiasts stopped to think about it, any of them might simply assume that the most successful athletes $$$. However, new research shows $$$.
  * These findings challenge $$$’s common assumptions that $$$
  * At first glance, teenagers appear to $$$, but on closer inspection $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Establishing_Why_Your_Claims_Matter"></span>**Establishing Why Your Claims Matter**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * X matters/is important because $$$
  * Although X may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of today’s concern over $$$
  * Ultimately, what is at stake here is $$$
  * These findings have important consequences for the broader domain of $$$
  * My discussion of X is in fact addressing the larger matter of $$$
  * These conclusions / This discovery will have significant application in $$$ as well as in $$$
  * Although X may seem of concern to only a small group of $$$, it should in fact concern anyone who cares about $$$

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Adding_Meta-commentary"></span>**Adding Meta-commentary**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * In other words, $$$
  * What $$$ really means by this is $$$
  * My point is $$$
  * Essentially, I am arguing that $$$
  * My point is not that we should $$$, but that we should $$$
  * What $$$ really means is $$$
  * In other words, $$$
  * To put it another way, $$$
  * In sum, then, $$$
  * My conclusion, then is that, $$$

  * By the way, $$$
  * Chapter two explores $$$, while Chapter three examines $$$
  * Having just argued that $$$, let us now turn our attention to $$$.
  * Although some readers may object that $$$, I would answer that $$$.
