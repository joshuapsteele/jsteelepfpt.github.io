Sunday worship is shaped by the ancient two-fold pattern of Word and Sacrament. This pattern has been present in Christian worship from the early days and in the vast majority of Christian churches throughout the world and the many cultures in which Christianity has flourished.  It is not a balance of Word and Sacrament so much as it is a wholeness of both, blended together into a two-part unity of purpose. And that purpose is to worship God and to receive together the gifts of his word, his life, his mercy, and his presence, all through our Lord Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.

The elements of our worship are, for the most part, not unique to the churches of the Anglican Communion.  Most are continuing components from the early Church and the tradition of worship in Western Christianity.  Some prayers and themes are borrowed from Eastern rites, some from Reformed worship, and some from Lutheran services.  Almost all, however, has been adapted and changed to fit the unique Anglican understanding of itself as a reformed catholic church. This is where ordered flexibility comes in handy.
