A couple relevant excerpts (given recent [posts][1]) from &#8220;Violence and Peace,&#8221; the final chapter of Miroslav Volf&#8217;s _[Exclusion and Embrace][2] _(my emphasis added in **bold**; paragraph breaks added where noted): 

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  &#8220;God will judge, not because God gives people what they deserve, but <strong>because some people refuse to receive what no one deserves; if evildoers experience God&#8217;s terror, it will not be because they have done evil, but because they have resisted to the end the powerful lure of the open arms of the crucified Messiah</strong>.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  &#8220;If we accept the stubborn irredeemability of some people, do we not end up with an irreconcilable contradiction at the heart of Christian faith? Here the &#8220;crucified Messiah&#8221; with arms outstretched embracing the &#8220;vilest sinner,&#8221; there the Rider on the white horse with a sharp sword coming from his mouth to strike down the hopelessly wicked? The patient love of God over against the fury of God&#8217;s wrath? Why this polarity? [Paragraph break added]
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  &#8220;Not because the God of the cross is different from the God of the second coming. After all, the cross is not forgiveness pure and simple, but God&#8217;s <em>setting aright the world of injustice and deception</em>. The polarity is there because some human beings refuse to be &#8220;set aright.&#8221; <strong>Those who take divine suffering (the cross) as a display of divine weakness that condones violence &#8212; instead of divine grace that restores the violator &#8212; draw upon themselves divine anger (the sword) that makes an end to their violence.</strong> [Paragraph break added]
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  &#8220;The violence of the Rider on the white horse, I suggest, is the <em>symbolic portrayal of the final exclusion of everything that refuses to be redeemed by God&#8217;s suffering love</em>. For the sake of the peace of God&#8217;s good creation, we can and must affirm <em>this</em><em> </em>divine anger and <em>this</em> divine violence, while at the same time <strong>holding on to the hope that in the end, even the flag bearer will desert the army that desires to make war against the Lamb.</strong>&#8221; (pp. 298-299)
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  &#8220;The thesis about the correspondence between divine and human action rightly underlines that the fundamental theological question in relation to violence is the question about God: &#8220;What is God like?&#8221; &#8212; the God who &#8220;loves enemies and is the original peace maker&#8221; (Yoder 1985, 104) or the God of vengeance, out to punish the insubordinate? The thesis has, however, one small but fatal flaw:<strong> humans are not God. There is a duty prior to the duty of imitating God, and that is the duty <em>of not wanting to be God</em>, of letting God be God and humans be humans. Without such a duty guarding the divinity of God the duty to imitate God would be empty because our concept of God would be nothing more than the mirror image of ourselves.</strong>&#8221; (301)
