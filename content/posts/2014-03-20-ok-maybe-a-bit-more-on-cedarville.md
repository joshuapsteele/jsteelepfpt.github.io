You&#8217;ll notice that [the previous post on Cedarville][1] ends with a link to [the Course Schedule][2]:

&#8220;Class Limited to Women&#8221; &#8230; I know, ludicrous. Especially considering Joy Fagan&#8217;s previous track record of making the first class, Scriptural Interpretation of Gender Issues (or SIGI), a truly excellent course by all accounts from former students, male and female.

Equally ludicrous? The [textbook choices][4]! Are you ready for what CU students will be reading to form an even-handed perspective of what the Bible has to say on gender? Maybe some [Miroslav Volf][5]? [&#8220;Junia is Not Alone&#8221; by Scot McKnight][6]? NOPE.

Words fail.

Cedarville, get your act together. Prospective students, stay far away until the institution recovers it&#8217;s broad evangelical vision (the one carried forward by Bill Brown and Carl Ruby, for example). Unfortunately, it appears that vision has been thoroughly squashed in the conservative takeover.
