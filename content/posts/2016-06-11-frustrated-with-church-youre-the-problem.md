Yesterday, I asked you [to join the Church if you, like me, are frustrated with the Church][1]. The strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community. Plus, your frustrations are likely shared by many others within the Church!

However, it&#8217;s not enough to point the finger at others from your pew, instead of doing so from the public square. Yes, that&#8217;s a good first step, but another one is necessary.

##### You &#8211; and I &#8211; need to be willing to take ownership for the Church&#8217;s failures.

Now, (1) does this mean that we&#8217;re to always play the scapegoat, even when the problems aren&#8217;t directly our fault? (2) Wouldn&#8217;t this open us up to the risk of ignoring the persecution of others by corrupt and power-hungry leaders within the Church?

(1) No, because (2) yes, it potentially could.

What I&#8217;m getting at, however, is that **we must always be willing to admit that the Church&#8217;s biggest flaws find their roots in the fact that every single churchman and churchwoman is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sinner</span>.**

And let&#8217;s not kid ourselves &#8211; we&#8217;re sinners not in the vague, abstract sense of having broken an esoteric list of rules. We are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>concrete sinners</strong></span>, each corrupt, selfish, and violent.

The moment we attempt to distance ourselves from &#8220;those sinners over there,&#8221; we open ourselves to the risk of committing the very worst sins against others &#8211; within and without the Church.

Only when we Christians begin to take ownership for the failings of the Church (of which we are a part) can the Church adopt its most successful posture: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>repentance</strong></em></span>.

> &#8220;Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgement; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgement; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences &#8211; and certainly one day purified of some of them &#8211; it would be the Church of God.&#8221; ~ Karl Barth, _The Epistle to the Romans_, 370.

Repentance requires the realization that we are under judgement.

When the Church self-righteously condemns the world, it refuses repentance. But the answer is not to join the world and self-righteously condemn the Church! It is rather to model realization and repentance from within the Church.

I&#8217;m frustrated with the Church, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I&#8217;m</strong></span> the problem.

Are you?
