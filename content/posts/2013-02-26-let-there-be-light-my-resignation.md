<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>**Please read:</strong> </em></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong><a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/leadership-transfer-2/">Let There Be Light &#8211; Leadership Transfer</a></strong></em></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>**</strong></em></span>

**Until further notice, I hereby rescind my use of the Let There Be Light platform** (including [blog][1], [Facebook][2], and [Twitter][3]) **to protest recent changes at Cedarville University.** The LTBL platform will now be _**exclusively alumni-run**_, and I encourage everyone interested in developments at the University to follow their posts and make subsequent judgments regarding Cedarville&#8217;s identity and vision.

My goal in all of this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>to honor my Messiah by following him well and furthering his Kingdom with justice, unity, and true peace.</strong></span>

Let it be known that **I am bitterly disappointed with the direction in which Cedarville University is currently heading.** Unless its leaders frankly and forthrightly admit their agenda for the future and their recent decisions including the firing of Dr. Carl Ruby, I cannot in good conscience recommend Cedarville to any prospective students. If CU leaders are willing to get rid of people like Dr. Ruby and yet unwilling to admit that they&#8217;ve done so, that&#8217;s not just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">disingenuous</span> &#8211; it&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">dangerous</span>.

I also cannot recommend a place which holds un-scholarly documents as [the White Papers][4] as official explanations of its doctrinal stances. I cannot recommend a place where people like Dr. Michael Pahl are not allowed to teach, and where good evangelicals are &#8220;reviewed&#8221; by ad hoc doctrinal panels. I cannot recommend a place where my mentors are harassed for being forthright with their students. If [Bob Gresh&#8217;s words are true and men like Mr. Scharnberg want to return Cedarville University to the &#8220;real Cedarville&#8221; of 19 years ago][5], I cannot support such a move. That&#8217;s not the Cedarville I&#8217;ve known and loved.

**My resignation from [Let There Be Light][1] does not change these personal opinions**. However, I do pray that Cedarville might change and thrive, so that one day I can gladly and sincerely recommend it once more.

I will continue to use my own personal social media outlets to express my views freely and openly. For now, as a current student of Cedarville University, I will content myself with asking questions, trying to make sense of all this, and encouraging the members of the CU community who have had the biggest impact on my life.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">With people like Carl Ruby, Chris Williamson, and Bill Rudd gone, we&#8217;re quickly losing leaders at Cedarville who will advocate for these types of concerns.</span>** I&#8217;m therefore convinced that my time left at Cedarville will be better spent on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">encouragement</span> than <span style="text-decoration:underline;">advocacy</span>. Although I am unsatisfied with the recent decisions and direction of my University, there are still many good and godly women and men here whom I&#8217;d like to uplift and affirm before I graduate.

Although I will no longer be a contributing member of Let There Be Light, I ask you to join with me in always calling for transparency and justice within our respective communities. The justice-filled Kingdom of God is being built one context, one community at a time, all over the world.

I do not regret founding [Let There Be Light][1], nor do I regret my efforts to make Cedarville a more just community by striking a prophetic pose as a student with relatively little to lose. I&#8217;ve not done it perfectly (see my [Open Apology][6]), but speaking truth to power will always be necessary.

Our God is a god of justice, peace, and unity. There can be no true unity or peace without justice.

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <em><strong>He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.</strong></em><br /> <em><strong>    And what does the Lord require of you?</strong></em><br /> <em><strong>To act justly and to love mercy</strong></em><br /> <em><strong>    and to walk humbly with your God.</strong></em>
</p>

Grace and Peace,

Joshua Steele
