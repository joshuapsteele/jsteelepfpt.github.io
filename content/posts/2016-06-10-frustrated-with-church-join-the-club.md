&#8230;and by &#8220;club&#8221; I of course mean &#8220;Church&#8221;!

What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere &#8220;club&#8221;?

No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn&#8217;t it?

  * A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes.
  * A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping.
  * A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners.

Perhaps you&#8217;re sick of this &#8220;club,&#8221; and you&#8217;re ready to leave, if you haven&#8217;t left already.

I&#8217;m asking you to stay. To come back. To join for the first time.

Why?

Because the Church must be composed of people who realize the Church&#8217;s shortcomings and failures.

Otherwise, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>is</strong></em></span> **just a club.**

I&#8217;m asking you to stay, because most leaders within the Church share your frustrations.

Because the strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community.

And because, as I&#8217;ll talk about tomorrow, you&#8217;re part of the problems. And so am I.

So, let&#8217;s work toward solving them together. Within the Church.
