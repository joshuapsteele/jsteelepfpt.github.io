<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if the Church was an agent in this very work, forming people well to then love the world well? What if spiritual formation led to a life guided by the Spirit to do works of justice for all people?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the process of writing his latest book </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Peace</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bishop Todd Hunter was continually struck by how many millions of people experience their daily lives as harsh and oppressive—anything but peaceful. He began to ask the questions above.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This question reawakened him to a lifelong passion:</span> a community of Christians activated to do the true good in the world<span style="font-weight: 400;">. A community that includes all denominations, races, ages and political persuasions, intentionally formed to extend agape love into the hurt and injustice that surrounds us. This passion led him to start </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Formation, Justice and Peace.</span>][2] <span style="font-weight: 400;">In this interview, he shares how he’s coming alongside the Church to help people develop the inner character they need to consistently seek justice and peace in the manner of Jesus—so that all people may be made whole. </span>

Check out this Q&A with Bishop Todd:

**Anglican Compass: Is the Center geared toward Anglicans?**

**Bishop Todd Hunter:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center is intentionally interdenominational. I am an Anglican bishop. My diocese (C4SO.org) belongs to the Anglican Church in North America. The Center gathers followers of Jesus from any church who believe issues of justice and righteousness are directly addressed throughout the scriptures, calling the Church to be Divine instruments who cooperate with God as he expresses the rule and reign of his kingdom among us—specifically in the realm of human suffering and injustice. We seek to know what those justice-loaded texts mean. We desire to know the reality to which they point. We want to embody them, live fully into them. We want to follow Jesus as his cooperative friends into the social realities around us today, realities in which certain people groups are more consistently and flagrantly victimized.</span>

**Anglican Compass: Bishop Todd, what qualifies you to talk about justice? **

**BTH**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: I don’t come to the work of justice and peace feeling </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">qualified</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">. I tip-toe in feeling </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the prophecy of Isaiah and the words of Jesus and James, etc:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Isaiah 68:1: For I, the Lord, love justice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luke 4: to preach good news to the poor, to proclaim release to the prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind, to liberate the oppressed, and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew 25: I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me. I was naked and you gave me clothes to wear. I was sick and you took care of me. I was in prison and you visited me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">James 1: Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back at my journals, I have for years wanted the last era of my work to participate with the biblical vision of </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">shalom</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">. I have yearned for myself (and now others) to live into the profound realites suggested by the Old and New Testament words, </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">tzedek and dikaiosune</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">, that refer simultaneously to personal holiness/piety and social justice. My pursuit of Jesus and biblical shalom led me to a place where I could not separate formation from justice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been seeking my own spiritual formation and working on the edges of the spiritual formation movement for 30 years. While I have made good progress, I am far from perfect. I want my transformation to deepen. During the same decades, I have observed and honored colleagues who worked in various justice movements. My passion is to get formation and justice in conversation with each other. Why? This is a bit of a caricature, but too often formation is merely personal, and justice-seeking too often leads to burnout, anger at the Church and cynicism about the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the publication of my book </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Peace</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">(Zondervan, 2021) and founding </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Formation, Justice and Peace</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">, I am going public with what has been rattling around in my heart and brain: seek to become a truly good person, doing the true good, in a community of people who seek the same.</span>

**Anglican Compass:** **Why start a Center for Formation, Justice and Peace?**

**BTH:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">In starting the Center, we are not claiming to be the foremost expert on justice and peace in America. We want to show how Christian spiritual formation leads us toward a deeper desire for justice and peace for all God’s creation, because all people are created equal in the image of God. Our hope in starting the Center is to contribute to a more just Church and society, to center voices of color and to serve those who are already working on the front lines of justice and suffering. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a huge responsibility, for to whom much is given, much is required (Luke 12:48). We want to learn to use whatever advantage we have for the sake of others. This responsibility is not a heavy burden; nor is it ill-fitting. It is a free and light joy (Matthew 11, MSG). It is a delight to find our “Psalm 139 selves” and to take up our callings to come alongside those who are different from us. In the words of Lila Watson: “If you have come to help you are wasting your time, but if you believe that your liberation is bound up in mine then let us work together.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We come to this delicate, complex work with a mix of emotions: excited and hopeful—and aware of many weaknesses. The Center is not about me. It is not my platform. It is a platform for centering the voices of people we call Formed Well Heroes—women and men who are pursuing the transformation of their souls into Christlikeness by moving toward and with image-bearers who have often been cast to the margins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have learned that we must enter the space of justice work as beloved. I am grateful for and freed by this insight from Osheta Moore’s </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear White Peacemakers</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">. She writes:</span>

> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">I, a Black Peacemaker, am Beloved and you, White Peacemaker, are Beloved,</span>_
> 
> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">and we belong to each other.</span>_
> 
> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what we build our anti-racism peacemaking on, White Peacemaker.</span>_
> 
> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is our why.</span>_
> 
> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything else will disappear and overwhelm,</span>_
> 
> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the love of God owned and reflected</span>_
> 
> _<span style="font-weight: 400;">is the living water we need along the journey.</span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From that belovedness, we are striving to create a beloved community of all peoples.</span>

**Anglican Compass: What makes The Center different from other organizations seeking social justice?**

**BTH:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of a center seeking social justice is not original to us—Catholic Orders, various anabaptist groups and many others have paved the way. But in a contemporary sense, the difference is where we begin. Justice and peace come from the inside out—from the overflow of a transformed heart. Why we pursue justice, how we activate justice, and what we consider true peace all stem from the life and character of Jesus being formed in us. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing that makes The Center different is that it takes the individualized history of formation and turns the focus outward, while also marrying the outward focus of social justice with the inward work of Jesus. The expansiveness of Christ means that formation, justice and peace are both inward and outward.</span>

**What does the Center have to say about Marxism? Socialism? Critical Race Theory?**

**BTH:** <span style="font-weight: 400;">Our full devotion is to Jesus, not Marx, not Socialism. We don’t rely on 20th century social theorists to construe the ethics or to aim the actions of our lives. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marxist allegations commonly mischaracterize the actual beliefs of Christian leaders working in the area of race. We know thousands of Christian leaders all over the world and in most every denomination. None of these leaders who care about issues of race and want to work on it are motivated by CRT. In stark contrast, they are motivated by creation (Gen. 1:27; 3:20), by the patriarchs (Gen. 12:3), by the prophets (Amos 5:24), by Proverbs (31:8-9), by Jesus (Mt. 7:12; 22:39), by Paul (Acts 17:26; Romans 10:12; Gal. 3:26-28; Eph. 2:13-18; Phil. 2:3-4; Col. 3:11), by Peter (Acts 10:28, 34, 35) and by the revelation of racial and ethnic perfection given to John (Rev. 7:9). Similar to MLK before them, today’s Christian leaders—at least the ones we know—are animated by the beautiful biblical vision of the oneness of all humanity in Christ, living with each other on the basis of agape love. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of CRT, the Black church has been trying for decades—previous to and outside of the CRT framework—to make some of the same points now being made by CRT theorists. We don’t know of any orthodox Christian Black leader “buying into a false gospel” called Marxism. They are not anti-American or a threat to Christianity. CRT is not the secret ideological foundation of the Christian Black protest movement. We have not seen Black Christian leaders seek to victimize White males or destroy the structures of American life. Those things are antithetical to MLK’s tradition of agape love and a beloved community for all. The Black leaders we know are Christ-centered and deserve the support of the whole Church. And when they see other Christian leaders gathering together to make dubious public condemnations of CRT while remaining utterly silent about structural racism, showing no empathy, it only illustrates our blindness, harms our relationships, and inhibits our common mission to bring justice and equity to all of God’s image bearers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A solid way forward is to recall that all truth is God’s truth. If the lens of Critical Race Theory helps to truthfully identify underlying assumptions and structures that are otherwise hidden, isn’t that a gift, and the possible basis for healing and justice? As Ekemini Uwan says, &#8220;I am for truth no matter who tells it; I am for justice no matter who it is for, or against.&#8221; </span>

**Anglican Compass: How does the Gospel inform works of justice and peace? **

**BTH**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Gospel </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:1-6): his atoning death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and present-day ministry at the right hand of the Father. These biblical truths are core to our faith. But unto what? This is answered by the “Gospel </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus” found in Mark 1:14-15: </span>

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”</span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jesus, the Gospel was centered in that which his Father was doing. It was connected to the large story of Israel (“the time has come…”). It was manifested by the rule and reign of God in and through Jesus. This reality entailed then, and does now, a decision &#8211; to reconsider our whole lives (repent) and to place our whole confidence (believe) in Jesus. In this way, we become whole-life apprentices (disciples/students) of Jesus for the sake of others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In brief, we harmonize the Gospel about Jesus with the Gospel according to Jesus in this way: it is was to shocking to Jesus’ contemporaries, but the final will of God, the inauguration of his kingdom, which will one day be fulfilled at the Second Coming of Jesus, came not via military or political power, but through a crucified Messiah whom by the power of the resurrection the grave could not contain. At Jesus’ ascension, the Spirit was poured out on the church in power, authority, fruit and gifts, all for the purpose of being ambassadors of the kingdom Jesus announced in his teaching, modeled in his way of being, and demonstrated in his works of power. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have written about this extensively in my book, </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christianity Beyond Belief: Following Jesus for the Sake of Others</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jesus’ cooperative friends, we seek to join him in the inbreaking of God’s kingdom until fulfillment comes. That is the story which draws together the three emphases of The Center: formation into Christlikeness, pursuing justice and seeking peace.</span>

**Anglican Compass: How do you hope The Center impacts the Church?**

**BTH**<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Within the pursuit of justice, we hope to see an increased emphasis on spiritual practices and formation, specifically repentance and lament. Dennae Pierre, a member of our Advisory Board, says that repentance and lament, “…[are] the inner work necessary to engage long term in the ministry of justice and reconciliation in ways that reflect Jesus.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to lead and be with the Church as we willingly enter the uncomfortable territory that comes with recognizing, naming and walking out the work of the Spirit in the areas of repentance and lament.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Center, we are working toward these three sequential steps: 1) Trust and follow Jesus. 2) Join him in his work. 3) Recognize the need for your heart, soul, mind, emotions, will and body to be transformed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This outward and inward rhythm contains the core practices for formation, justice and peace.</span>
