# Podcasts: An Introduction

Although podcasts (think &#8220;iPod&#8221; + &#8220;broadcast&#8221;) have been around for over a decade, we&#8217;re living in a bit of a golden age &#8211; or a least a Rennaissance &#8211; of the medium. For the uninitiated, here&#8217;s a nice video about what podcasts are:

Currently, podcasts are one of my very favorite ways to consume information about a wide variety of topics. Sure, gun to my head, I&#8217;ll choose books over podcasts as a way to learn. However, unlike books (or videos), you can easily listen to podcasts while doing other things &#8211; whether folding laundry, washing dishes, or going for a run/walk.

(Note: as I mentioned in [my list of favorite tools and apps][1], [Overcast][2] is my current favorite podcast player. Although, there are plenty of other worthy podcast players/managers to check out!)

There are no shortage of podcasts, or lists of best podcasts, for that matter. However, here are my current favorites.

# My Favorite Podcasts:

## [Up First (NPR)][3]

This is the first podcast I listen to every weekday while making coffee. I love that it&#8217;s short (˜10 minutes) and that it provides some snapshots of important news stories that day. In addition to Up First, I frequently listen to NPR newscasts via their [NPR One app][4], which is worth checking out!

## [The Art of Manliness][5]

Sure, the egalitarian in me wishes there were a show out there called &#8220;The Art of Humanity&#8221; &#8211; about how to be a _Mensch. _However, in the meantime, Brett McKay has a solid podcast going about &#8220;reviving the lost art of manliness.&#8221; I enjoy the podcast (and t[he Art of Manliness website][6]) because it includes so many helpful how-to guides &#8211; for everything from weightlifting to men&#8217;s fashion.

## [Word & Table][7]

I created [Rookie Anglican][8] as a way of making Anglicanism more accessible. This podcast, Word & Table, has much the same mission, although it&#8217;s focus is not just on Anglicanism, but rather on the rich Christian tradition of liturgical worship. As I wrote about the podcast [over at Rookie Anglican][9]:

> According to their [website][7], Word & Table “is a weekly podcast about liturgy, sacrament, and the great tradition of Christian worship and why it is vital in our world today.”
> 
> The podcast was started back in October 2016, and it’s hosted by [Alex Wilgus][10] and Fr. [Stephen Gauthier][11], the Canon Theologian for the Anglican Church in North America’s Diocese of the Upper Midwest.
> 
> You can subscribe to the podcast via [iTunes][12], listen to episodes via the [Word & Table website][7], or simply search for “Word and Table” in your podcast player/manager of choice.

If you&#8217;ve got questions about anything related to the Christian tradition, check out the Word & Table podcast to see if they have an episode on the topic!

## [The Tim Ferriss Show][13]

I&#8217;ve become somewhat of a Tim Ferriss junkie in the past two years. In addition to this podcast &#8211; which features long-form interviews with &#8220;top performers,&#8221; in which Tim distils tips, tricks, habits, and practices for the common person &#8211; Ferriss&#8217; books are well worth checking out (Affiliate LInks: [The 4-Hour Workweek][14]; The [4-Hour Body][15]; The [4-Hour Chef][16]; [Tools of Titans][17]) . He&#8217;s great at teaching _[metalearning][18] _&#8211; how to learn how to learn!

(Note: Tim Ferriss is how I found out about [kettlebells][19] &#8211; one of my [favorite tools][1] for personal fitness.)

## [Coffee Break German][20]

Sure, Coffee Break German hasn&#8217;t taught me the kind of German that I&#8217;ll need for my Ph.D. German translation exam. However, it is a very informative introduction to basic/conversational German. It makes a wonderful companion to Duolingo for language learning! Radio Lingua Network offers [a whole suite of &#8220;Coffee Break&#8221; languages][21], including French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese!

## [This American Life][22]

In my opinion, no podcast beats This American Life in terms of the quality and variety of storytelling. It&#8217;s well worth your time, in addition to the &#8220;spinoff&#8221; shows [Serial][23] and [S-Town][24].

# Honorable Mentions:

  * [The Art of Charm][25]
  * [Always Forward][26]: Anglican Church Planting
  * [Monday Morning Preacher][27]
  * Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s [Revisionist History][28]
  * [Optimal Living Daily][29]
