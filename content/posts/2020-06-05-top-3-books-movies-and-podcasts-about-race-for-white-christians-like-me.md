There are PLENTY of resource recommendations out there for those interested in learning more about racism and anti-racism (just Google “best X (books, movies, podcasts, etc.) on racism,” “antiracist reading list,” etc.). 

However, I’m worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I’d much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won’t!

With that in mind, here is the reading, viewing, and listening shortlist that I am starting with. I’ve been biblically and theologically opposed to racism for awhile now, but I was convicted by the Rev. Canon Dr. Esau McCaulley recently when he said, like a good professor, that “we can tell when you haven’t done the reading.” I’ve done a _bit_ of the reading (mainly [_The Christian Imagination: Theology and the Origins of Race_][1] by Willie James Jennings, [_A Black Theology of Liberation_][2] by James Cone, and [_How to be an Antiracist_][3] by Ibram X. Kendi), but not nearly enough.

So, if you’re looking for a place to start, I recommend the following as a beginning. Within each category, take a brief look at all 3 and then start with the 1 that interests you the most.

## Books

  1. [_The Color of Compromise: The Truth about the American Church’s Complicity in Racism_][4] by Jemar Tisby (Also, if you have Amazon Prime, there’s a [free “Color of Compromise” video teaching series by Jemar Tisby][5])
  2. [ _White Fragility: Why It&#8217;s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism_][6] by Robin DiAngelo
  3. [_How to be an Antiracist_][3] by Ibram X. Kendi (I’ve listened to this on Audible, but I need to revisit it, along with Kendi’s [ _Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America_][7])

## Movies

  1. [Just Mercy][8] (Amazon)
  2. [I Am Not Your Negro][9] (Amazon)
  3. [13th][10] (Netflix)

## Podcasts

  1. [Seeing White][11]
  2. [Code Switch][12]
  3. [Truth’s Table][13]
