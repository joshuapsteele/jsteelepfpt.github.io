Do you speak [FOX][1]? Megan Garber writes:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    &#8220;Political theorists, over the years, have looked for metaphors to describe the effects that Fox—particularly its widely watched opinion shows—has had on American politics and culture. They’ve talked about the network as an “information silo” and “a filter bubble” and an “echo chamber,” as an “alternate reality” constructed of “alternative facts,” as a virus on the body politic, as an organ of the state. The comparisons are all correct. But they don’t quite capture what the elegies for Fox-felled loved ones express so efficiently. Fox, for many of its fans, is an identity shaped by an ever-expanding lexicon: <em>mob, PC police, Russiagate, deep state, MSM, MS-13, socialist agenda, Dems, libs, Benghazi, hordes, hoax, dirty, violent, invasion, open borders, anarchy, liberty, Donald Trump</em>. Fox has two pronouns, <em>you</em> and <em>they</em>, and one tone: indignation. (<em>You</em> are under attack; <em>they</em> are the attackers.) Its grammar is grievance. Its effect is totalizing. Over time, if you watch enough <em>Fox & Friends</em> or <em>The Five</em> or Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham, you will come to understand, as a matter of synaptic impulse, that immigrants are invading and the mob is coming and the news is lying and Trump alone can fix it.&#8221;

I resonated with this piece a lot.

Sure, every media organization has its biases, including The Atlantic (on this, by the way, I highly recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://www.adfontesmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ad Fontes Media Bias Chart</a>). But FOX News has become more and more like a right-wing propaganda machine and it, perhaps also along with Breitbart News and the like, has had a discernible effect on conversations with family, friends, and acquaintances.

Megan Garber puts words here to the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach I&#8217;ve experienced when, in the middle of a conversation with someone, I realize that they have such a different view of reality and means of describing it, that I&#8217;m not even sure if we&#8217;re speaking the same language anymore. It&#8217;s like suddenly realizing you&#8217;re walking through a field full of landmines. &#8220;Oh crap, how do I steer the conversation away from political topics?? Almost everything is political!!&#8221;

I&#8217;m not trying to paint myself as an unstained hero here, by the way. I am undoubtedly shaped by what I choose to read and listen to (I don&#8217;t watch TV news at all anymore and I highly recommend you give it up as well).

I just really wish that _we_ Christians (definitely including myself here) were known for being so saturated with Scripture that we sounded more like Jesus—in an organic and authentic way, not just proof-texting—than political pundits. I wish our pronouns, especially our use of &#8220;we,&#8221; were defined ecclesially instead of politically (&#8220;we&#8221;=&#8221;brothers and sisters in Christ,&#8221; not &#8220;we&#8221;=&#8221;my political tribe&#8221;).

Unfortunately, as I&#8217;ve said before, I think that, at least in the USA, FOX News is doing a much &#8220;better&#8221; (as in &#8220;consistent,&#8221; &#8220;thorough&#8221;) job at catechesis than the church is. (Yes yes, I&#8217;m sure there is also plenty of counter-catechesis on the Left. But, at least in my circles, the counter-catechesis of the Right is much more obvious and widespread.)
