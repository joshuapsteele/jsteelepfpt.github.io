This is from Robert Jenson, _Systematic Theology_, Volume 1, p. 11: 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The church has a mission: to see to the speaking of the gospel, whether to the world as message of salvation or to God as appeal and praise. Theology is the reflection internal to the church&#8217;s labor on this assignment.
  </p>
</blockquote>

(How) does this definition of &#8220;theology&#8221; differ from the one you&#8217;ve been working with?
