Getting Things Done (&#8220;GTD&#8221; for short) is a wildly popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017</a>, &#8220;You don‚Äôt hear a lot of people talk about the¬†<a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> productivity system anymore.&#8221;

I think that&#8217;s a shame, because it&#8217;s a very effective system.

I first tried Getting Things Done after reading &#8220;<a href="http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Best Nex</a>t&#8221; by Matt Perman, and then reading &#8220;<a href="http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Things Done</a>&#8221; by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.

At its core, GTD revolves around the following idea from David Allen:

### &#8220;Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.&#8221;

What&#8217;s that mean? Well, your brain does a much better job of coming up with random things than with keeping track of them. Therefore,¬†if you don&#8217;t have a system in place for reliably and comprehensively keeping track of all the random &#8220;open loops&#8221; your brain comes up with throughout the day, you will use up a lot of your mental bandwidth trying to keep track of all those things, instead of moving forward on them.

Enter the GTD system. It&#8217;s designed to solve the problem of keeping track of the &#8220;open loops&#8221; your brain comes up with, whether &#8220;I need to buy milk&#8221; or &#8220;I need to revamp my blog.&#8221;

# The &#8220;Pillars&#8221; of GTD

  1. **Capture**. Think on paper. Get stuff out of your head and into a list.
  2. **Clarify**. Decide whether or not each item on your list is an action, a project, something to delete, defer, or delegate, etc. Check out this <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTD Workflow Chart</a>.
  3. **Organize**. As you clarify, put things into different &#8220;buckets&#8221; &#8211; Action Lists, Project Lists, Someday/Maybe Lists, Waiting For Lists, Reference Materials, etc.
  4. **Review**. Look at your buckets!! Daily and weekly.
  5. **Engage**. You know, get. stuff. done.

# Getting Back on the GTD Bandwagon

Unfortunately, after following GTD for a few years, I &#8220;fell off the bandwagon.&#8221; I started to get sloppy with my practices of capturing and clarifying my &#8220;open loops,&#8221; so I started to spend more of my time worrying about what I had to get done that I was forgetting about, instead of reviewing my &#8220;Next Action&#8221; lists and getting things done, GTD-style.

So, just this past week, I decided to get back on the GTD bandwagon. I&#8217;ve got a Ph.D. dissertation to write and a baby on the way, after all! There&#8217;s no time to spend all day worrying about the things I&#8217;m forgetting! üôÇ

# My GTD Tools

## <a href="https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/203799792-Getting-Things-Done-GTD-with-Todoist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ToDoist</a>

ToDoist is a fantastic task manager. I use it to keep track of my personal tasks and projects.

## <a href="https://calendar.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Calendar</a>

I use Google Calendar as my&#8230;calendar. Pretty straightforward. üôÇ

## <a href="https://mail.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gmail</a>

I use Gmail¬†for email communication. In addition to folders created automatically by <a href="https://unroll.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unroll.Me</a> and <a href="https://www.boomeranggmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boomerang</a> (two FANTASTIC things to use in conjunction with Gmail), I have three simple folders:

  * @ACTION_SUPPORT
  * @KEEP
  * @WAITING\_FOR\_SUPPORT

If I receive an email that requires action from me, I place it in the @ACTION_SUPPORT folder and create a task in ToDoist reminding me to do the action.

If I receive an email that doesn&#8217;t contain an action, but that I want to keep for reference purposes, I either click &#8220;Archive&#8221; in GMail, or I move it to the &#8220;@KEEP&#8221; folder.

If I have an email that I can&#8217;t take the next action on, but that I&#8217;m waiting for someone to take an action before I can move forward, I create a task in ToDoist reminding me to follow up on this, and I move the email to the @WAITING\_FOR\_SUPPORT folder.

## <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evernote</a>

Evernote is basically my second brain and reference file system. Everything from old receipts to class notes is in there.

### <a href="http://amzn.to/2FG5Ccu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leuchtturm1917 Medium Size Hardcover A5 Notebook &#8211; Dotted Grid</a>

This is my favorite notebook and tool for &#8220;capturing&#8221; ideas, projects, actions, etc.

# Some Good Overviews of GTD

The best overview of the GTD system is the aforementioned book, &#8220;<a href="http://amzn.to/2FC6IWz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Things Done</a>.&#8221;

However,¬†there are also some very helpful free overviews of the GTD system out there.
