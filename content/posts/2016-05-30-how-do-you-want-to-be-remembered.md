Do you know what the worst thing about _**death**_ is?

It&#8217;s not the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dying</span> itself &#8211; its the **separation**.

That is, we don&#8217;t suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.

A sad reality, to be sure.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_if_however_we_could_use_death_to_our_own_advantage"></span>What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

I&#8217;m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 &#8211;

> <span id="en-NIV-17432" class="text Eccl-7-2">It is better to go to a house of mourning</span>  
> <span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">than to go to a house of feasting,</span></span>  
> <span class="text Eccl-7-2">for death is the destiny of everyone;</span>  
> <span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">the living should take this to heart.</span></span>

Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn&#8217;t enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a _**resurrection**_.

But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there&#8217;s something to be gained by considering how you&#8217;d like to be remembered by others after you die.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_do_you_want_to_be_remembered"></span>How do you want to be remembered:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * ## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="by_God"></span>by God?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * ## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="by_your_spouse"></span>by your spouse?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * ## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="by_your_children"></span>by your children?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * ## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="by_your_parents"></span>by your parents?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * ## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="by_your_family_and_friends"></span>by your family and friends?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * ## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="by_your_colleagues"></span>by your colleagues?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

For me, I&#8217;d like to be remembered:

  * &#8230;as God&#8217;s faithful servant.
  * &#8230;as my wife&#8217;s best friend.
  * &#8230;as my children&#8217;s most important teacher.
  * &#8230;as my parents&#8217; legacy.
  * &#8230;as my family and friends&#8217; loyal brother.
  * &#8230;as my colleagues inspiring teammate.

&#8230;which sounds great, right? But here&#8217;s the rub:

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_changes_do_you_and_I_need_to_make_in_our_lives_to_start_making_those_hypothetical_memories_more_realistic_each_day"></span>What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">changes</span> do you and I need to make in our lives, to start making those hypothetical memories more realistic each day?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments below, as I consider how taking death to heart should impact one&#8217;s entire life.
