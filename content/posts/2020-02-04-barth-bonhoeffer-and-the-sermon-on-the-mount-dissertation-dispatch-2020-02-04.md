I&#8217;m still very much in the weeds, taking a closer look at how Bonhoeffer and Barth read the Sermon on the Mount. 

Given the importance of the Sermon on Mount for Bonhoeffer&#8217;s life and work, I&#8217;m persuaded that there&#8217;s something important to be found here—something that will hopefully shed some light on the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship re:their theological critiques of religion.

Additionally, there are at least two other tidbits that have me interested in how Barth and Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount. 

[On October 17, 1934, Bonhoeffer wrote to Gandhi,][1] inquiring about the possibility of going to India in order to learn how to develop &#8220;a truly spiritual living Christian peace movement.&#8221; In that letter, Bonhoeffer writes:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

    We are having great theologians in Germany—the greatest of them being in my opinion Karl Barth, whose disciple and friend I am happy to be—they are teaching us the great theological thoughts of the Reformation anew, but there is no-one to show us the way towards a new Christian life in uncompromising accordance with the Sermon on the Mount. It is in this respect that I am looking up to you for help.

On September 19, 1936, Bonhoeffer wrote the following to Karl Barth. He is commenting on their lack of communication since the fall of 1933.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

    There are all sorts of reasons that I have not written since then. I always thought that if I were to write you, I would have to have something reasonable to say, but something reasonable in that sense was precisely what I never had, at least not such that I thought I might take up your time. And I still do not have that today. Besides, <strong>I also wanted to arrive at a certain point on my own with regard to the particular questions that emerged for me from Scripture and which constantly occupied me at the time; in the process I quite frankly repeatedly discovered that in several points I was probably moving away from what you yourself think about these questions. Basically the entire period was an ongoing, silent dispute with you, which is why I had to remain silent for a while. Primarily it involved questions concerning the interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount and the Pauline doctrine of justification and sanctification.</strong> I am currently working on this material and would very much have liked to ask you and hear your views on so many things.

Now, what&#8217;s really intriguing to me is \*why\* Bonhoeffer would think, in 1934–36, that Barth&#8217;s interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount was insufficient. Was this just a general sense, based upon familiarity with Barth&#8217;s theology? Or did Bonhoeffer have some particular Barthian exegesis in mind?
