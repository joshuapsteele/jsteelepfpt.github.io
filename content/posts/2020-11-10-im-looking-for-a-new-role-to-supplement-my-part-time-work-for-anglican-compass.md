Hey everyone! Just a brief update to note that I&#8217;m looking for a new role to supplement my part-time work as Managing Editor of [Anglican Compass][1]!

Iâ€™m pretty flexible at this point, but I want to do something that benefits the church. I think I would make a great Assistant Rector! ðŸ™‚

Any advice, opportunities, or connections you can offer would be appreciated!

You can [view/share my CV here][2]. And [here&#8217;s my LinkedIn profile][3].
