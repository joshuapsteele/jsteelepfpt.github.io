# [BEST PEN: Zebra F-701 Stainless Steel Ballpoint Retractable Pen][1]

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Stainless-Ballpoint-Retractable-29411/dp/B002L6RB80/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1500599484&sr=1-6&keywords=zebra+pen&linkCode=li3&tag=joshuapsteele-20&linkId=63095167a57fe5aabdba40d971ba2069" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B002L6RB80&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=joshuapsteele-20" alt="Zebra stainless steel pen photo" width="80" height="250" border="0" /></a>

This is my &#8220;desert island&#8221; pen. It may not be the very best pen in the whole wide world, but I&#8217;m quite sure it&#8217;s the pen at the intersection of durability, versatility, and affordability.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=joshuapsteele-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B002L6RB80" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> If you really want to, you can [&#8220;hack&#8221; the F701 by putting in a better ink cartridge][2]. But I&#8217;ve been perfectly happy with the standard Zebra refills.

# [<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large">BEST NOTEBOOK: Leuchtturm1917 Medium Size Hardcover A5 Notebook &#8211; Dotted Pages</span>][3] {#title.a-size-large.a-spacing-none}

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Size-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1500599619&sr=8-3&keywords=leuchtturm1917+dotted+a5&linkCode=li3&tag=joshuapsteele-20&linkId=d8c482d03b50419d87a67626ecdae007" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B002TSIMW4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=joshuapsteele-20" alt="Leuchtturm 1917 Notebook photo" width="173" height="250" border="0" /></a><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=joshuapsteele-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B002TSIMW4" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />I use this notebook for a personal combination of the [Bullet Journal][4] method, [Morning Pages][5] journaling, and the [5-Minute Journal][6]. It&#8217;s a step up, paper-wise from a Moleskine, yet still affordable &#8211; and I love the Medium/A5 size. Currently, I&#8217;m on my third one, which is &#8220;anthracite gray.&#8221; The first two were black, then navy blue. I prefer dotted pages, but they also have ruled and blank page options.

# [BEST PASSWORD MANAGER: LastPass][7]

[<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-39768 size-full" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed-1.png" alt="Lastpass logo" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed-1.png 300w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed-1-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][7]

In case you don&#8217;t already have and use a password manager, you should really really get one. But don&#8217;t just take my word for it, here&#8217;s an informative piece from Wired about [why you need a password manager][8].

I started using LastPass a couple years back, and I haven&#8217;t looked back. My wife and I both share a premium account &#8211; installed on our internet browsers and phones.

# [BEST SECOND BRAIN: Evernote][9]

[<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-39770 size-medium" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon-300x300.png" alt="Evernote logo" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon-300x300.png 300w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon-150x150.png 150w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon-768x768.png 768w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon-1200x1200.png 1200w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evernote_icon.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][9]

I use Evernote primarily as my all-in-one digital file-cabinet &#8211; my &#8220;second brain,&#8221; as the company itself calls it. I&#8217;ve been paying for a premium subscription for awhile now, but the free version is quite robust and worth checking out. As far as [organizing my Evernotes goes][10], I&#8217;m currently using [Michael Hyatt&#8217;s tag-based system][11], although I started off just using notebooks and stacks of notebooks.

# [<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large">FAVORITE FITNESS TOOL: CAP Barbell Cast Iron Competition Weight Kettlebell &#8211; 35 Lbs.</span>][12] {#title.a-size-large.a-spacing-none}

      As <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/05/25/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/">I&#8217;ve mentioned before on this blog</a>, one of the best exercises in the entire world is the two-handed kettlebell swing. If you&#8217;re short on time, but would still like to improve your strength and overall fitness, I <em><strong>highly</strong></em> recommend starting up a basic kettlebell workout routine. Check out <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/04/15/kettlebell-swing/">this Art of Manliness article about the kettlebell swing</a> to get started.

Therefore, in order to keep track of everything I have to get done, I have found an external task management system absolutely indispensable. I&#8217;ve tried a TON of different task managers, but Todoist has been my favorite for awhile now.

I prefer having an actual watch on my wrist (and, [according to Business Insider][13], I&#8217;m not alone), so that I don&#8217;t have to take my phone out of my pocket to check the time. Granted, I don&#8217;t have a favorite watch for females. And, granted, there are much nicer, more elaborate, more expensive watches available out there. However, much like my pen choice above, this watch stands at the intersection of functionality, durability, and affordability. If you&#8217;re looking for an even cheaper analog option, check out the <span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><a href="http://amzn.to/2tN5AsA">Casio Men&#8217;s MQ24-7B2</a> (recommended by <a href="http://kk.org/cooltools/ten-dollar-watchyoutube-toolthe-making-of-me-and-you/">Kevin Kelly via Cool Tools</a>). </span>

# [BEST TOOL FOR PODCASTS: Overcast][14]

[<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-39764 size-medium" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/imageproxy-300x188.png" alt="Overcast logo" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/imageproxy-300x188.png 300w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/imageproxy.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][14]I think that &#8211; after books &#8211; podcasts are one of the best ways out there to learn and stay interesting. Plus, unlike books (and Youtube videos), you can easily listen to a podcast while doing something else, such as washing the dishes or folding laundry. Apple&#8217;s native Podcasts app has come a very long way, and is worth checking out. However, my favorite podcast app is currently (the free version of) Overcast. To get all &#8220;meta&#8221; on you, here&#8217;s [an excellent podcast episode about podcasting][15]. Check it out if you&#8217;re even somewhat confused about what podcasts are.

(If you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s [a list of my favorite podcasts][16].)

# [BEST POCKET KNIFE: Gordon Drop Point EDC Pocket Knife (Harbor Freight)][17][<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-39762 size-medium" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/63168_zzz_500-300x300.jpg" alt="Harbor Freight pocket knife" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/63168_zzz_500-300x300.jpg 300w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/63168_zzz_500-150x150.jpg 150w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/63168_zzz_500-768x768.jpg 768w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/63168_zzz_500-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/63168_zzz_500.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][17]

Just like the pen and the watch recommended above, this is NOT the nicest knife in the world. However, it is functional, durable, and VERY affordable. Pick one up at/via Harbor Freight Tools.

# [BEST TOOL FOR LEARNING/MEMORY: Anki (Flashcard Software)][18]

[<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-39767 size-medium" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anki-icon.svg_-300x300.png" alt="Anki logo" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anki-icon.svg_-300x300.png 300w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anki-icon.svg_-150x150.png 150w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anki-icon.svg_-768x768.png 768w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anki-icon.svg_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anki-icon.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][18]

This is the tool I wish I knew about back in high school. [Spaced repetition][19] is a key to successful and time-efficient learning. And Anki bakes spaced repetition into flashcard reviews. I started using Anki, on the recommendation of [Gabriel Wyner&#8217;s _Fluent Forever_][20], to learn German for my PhPh.D.rogram. However, the uses of Anki are virtually endless when it comes to learning. Granted, the learning curve is a bit steep, but check out [Wyner&#8217;s guide to using Anki][21] as a way of getting started.

(Note: as I mention in [my list of favorite podcasts][16], Coffee Break German (and [Radio Lingua&#8217;s other Coffee Break language courses][22]) are also great language-learning tools!)

# Honorable Mentions: Other Tools Worth Trying

I&#8217;lll do my best to periodically update this list of recommendations.

  * <span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><a href="http://amzn.to/2uggudD">Hammer Anvil RFID Blocking Minimalist Genuine Leather Slim Front Pocket Wallet</a></span>
  * [Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Computer Glasses with SCT-Orange Lens][23]

Finally, this isn&#8217;t a tool, per se, but it IS one of the coolest collections of tool recommendations I know of: [Cool Tools][24]. Check the website out, and let me know what you find!
