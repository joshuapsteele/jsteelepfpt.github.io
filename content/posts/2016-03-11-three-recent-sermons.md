It&#8217;s been a grueling past few weeks at [Beeson][1]. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can&#8217;t come quickly enough!

Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God&#8217;s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!

I have preached twice in the past month on [Psalm 32][2]. First, I delivered a sermon (&#8220;The Refreshment of Forgiveness&#8221;) designed for the [Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C][3], for Dr. Doug Webster&#8217;s Preaching Practicum.

Then, I preached/presented on the same passage for Dr. Allen Ross&#8217;s Exegesis of Psalms (&#8220;Psalm 32: Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups&#8221;).

[soundcloud url=&#8221;https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248878329&#8243; params=&#8221;color=ff5500&auto\_play=false&hide\_related=false&show\_comments=true&show\_user=true&show_reposts=false&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; height=&#8221;166&#8243; iframe=&#8221;true&#8221; /]

Preparing and preaching these very **different** sermons on the **same** passage was a good reminder of the inexhaustible richness of Scripture.

Most recently, I got to compose a &#8220;crisis sermon&#8221; for Dr. Webster&#8217;s Preaching Practicum (&#8220;Lamenting into Worship&#8221;). One of my classmates preached a post-9/11 sermon. Another, post-Pearl Harbor! These were great sermons, but I chose a different route: **preaching to a congregation after the death of a well-known church family&#8217;s baby**.

[soundcloud url=&#8221;https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249874403&#8243; params=&#8221;color=ff5500&auto\_play=false&hide\_related=false&show\_comments=true&show\_user=true&show_reposts=false&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; height=&#8221;166&#8243; iframe=&#8221;true&#8221; /]

This was a stretching experience, to say the least. I pray I never have to preach this sermon in real life, but it was a good reminder to preach the good news to myself that God hates death more than we do.

You can listen to and/or read &#8220;The Refreshment of Forgiveness,&#8221; &#8220;Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups,&#8221; and &#8220;Lamenting into Worship,&#8221; along with my other sermons [at the **Sermons Page** of this site][4].

Now, there are much better preachers out there in the world, so if you&#8217;re short on time, go listen to them preach! But, if you&#8217;ve got the time to give these sermons a listen, I would greatly appreciate your [**feedback**][5] as I try to improve as a preacher and teacher of God&#8217;s Word!
