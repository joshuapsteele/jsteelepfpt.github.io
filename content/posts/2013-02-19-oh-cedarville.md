Have you ever been extremely frustrated with someone/thing you love?

That&#8217;s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, [I love this place.][1] And that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God&#8217;s Kingdom. And that&#8217;s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. [I&#8217;ve written about this before][2] (Open Letter).

The sources of my angst? I&#8217;ll give you the top three from my growing list of concerns.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_White_Papers"></span>The White Papers<img decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.callcentrehelper.com/images/stories/2010/white_papers.gif" /><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

I found out about these a year ago, when I had no idea of the storm that was brewing. I won&#8217;t spend time repeating what&#8217;s already been well said about the Papers [here][3] and [here][4], but suffice it to say that if I turned in a White Paper as an undergraduate theological essay, I&#8217;d be getting a C- and a talk from my professor for my sub-par work. It&#8217;s patently obvious that Bib/Theo scholars were NOT consulted in the composition of these documents. Or, if they were, they were summarily ignored. And CU is making PhDs in Bib/Theo studies sign these things! Despicable.

This seems like a shameful attempt of reigning in the &#8220;creeping liberalism&#8221; of Cedarville&#8217;s Bible department. First, if you know any of the conservative evangelical CU Bible faculty, you&#8217;ll realize that this is some sort of sick joke. Second, at least proofread your documents to the standards of good scholarship! Even if I agreed with the White Papers&#8217; attempts to silence debate and discussion on matters related to creation, justification, and omniscience, I would still be ashamed of their poor quality.

If you haven&#8217;t read Cedarville&#8217;s White Papers, they can _finally_ be found [here][5] (to the right), on the University website. We had to petition and then wait <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a couple months</strong></span> before the Administration publicly posted the White Papers, even though they are supposed to describe the University&#8217;s _**official position**_ on three important areas of doctrine!!! Did Cedarville ever intend on releasing these documents if students hadn&#8217;t petitioned Dr. Gredy and Dr. Cornman? Or were the White Papers just supposed to be a secret weapon to cleanse the Bible faculty? Apparently they were important enough to be used in the firing of Dr. Michael Pahl.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Michael_Pahl"></span>Michael Pahl<img decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2011/Michael-Pahl.jpg" /><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Dr. Pahl was hired before the 2011-12 school year. He moved his family (wife and four children) all the way from Canada to Cedarville, OH, persuaded that he was going to be a good fit for the Bible department at Cedarville University. After all, the CU hiring process is lengthy and it&#8217;s a very long way to move one&#8217;s family. After teaching for just two semesters, and closing on a 100 year-old farmhouse in town, he was fired for a doctrinal discrepancy related to his book, [The Beginning and The End][6].

Keep in mind that the book was already in manuscript form when he was hired by CU, meaning that he wrote this book before he even knew he&#8217;d be working at a place that would have loved to see a shout out to Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis somewhere, anywhere in the tome&#8217;s 106 pages. Furthermore, the hiring committee was made aware of Dr. Pahl&#8217;s forthcoming book, and he taught his sample lecture during the hiring process on Genesis and the creation accounts! But that wasn&#8217;t enough to save him from getting &#8220;reviewed&#8221; by an _ad hoc_ panel and &#8220;released from his teaching duties.&#8221;

Thankfully, he&#8217;s remained on the school&#8217;s payroll this academic year, so that he and his family didn&#8217;t get sent back to Canada right away without work or housing. However, to the best of my knowledge, he is still looking for work.

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  &#8220;Dr. Pahl’s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility.  He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.  Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.&#8221;
</p>

What a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">shameful way to treat a gracious and godly immigrant family.</span>

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Carl_Ruby"></span>Carl Ruby<img decoding="async" class="alignright" alt="" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2012/Carl-Ruby-13_001.jpg?w=250" /><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

As if the previous two concerns weren&#8217;t enough, the University quickly got rid of Carl Ruby, the Vice President for Student Life, this January. Not only have the Administration and Trustees neglected to justify this decision, they refuse to admit that they made the decision in the first place!!! According to the University PR statements, we&#8217;re to believe that Carl Ruby, after 25 years of service to his alma mater, randomly decided in January that now would be a great time to seek employment opportunities elsewhere. Apparently he also thought it would be great to leave his office just five days after his resignation was announced for him!

What&#8217;s the other option? Moral or legal failure, right? Well, Dr. Gredy (acting CU President) himself denied this at the [SGA Town Hall meeting last month][7], saying that Ruby&#8217;s resignation was not due to a personal/moral failure.

What&#8217;s left, then? Well, despite my University&#8217;s urging to &#8220;not connect the dots&#8221; on these matters, the unavoidable conclusion is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Dr. Ruby was FIRED</strong> </em></span>and that CU Admins/Trustees are hesitant (and deceptively so) to admit that.

Compare this &#8220;official&#8221; answer from the [Cedarville Alumni and Family Questions and Answers][8] page:

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Why did Dr. Carl Ruby leave? </span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Dr. John Gredy, Provost, <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Ruby-Legacy-Built-at-Cedarville-University.aspx"><span style="color:#000000;">announced to the University family</span></a> on January 10 that he and Dr. Ruby had come to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a mutual understanding</span> and that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr. Ruby would conclude his service to Cedarville University</span>. His last day in the office was shortly thereafter, although Dr. Ruby’s administrative contract continues through June 30. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The University is committed to protecting the privacy of its employees so is not commenting publicly on the reasons for the decision</span>.</span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Sadly, much speculation and questions have arisen. The Board of Trustees at its January 25 meeting carefully reviewed the events surrounding the announcement that Dr. Carl Ruby would conclude his service. The Board acknowledged and expressed regret that the lack of clarity had made this transition even more difficult for the Cedarville University family. Nonetheless, the Board of Trustees supported <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the understanding between Dr. Ruby and the administration</span>. The Board of Trustees expressed its gratitude to Dr. Ruby for his service.</span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Dr. Ruby built a legacy at Cedarville, and he will be missed by many. The passions Dr. Ruby embraced were not simply his personal interests, but rather reflect core values of the Cedarville family. The University is committed to continuing these priorities.&#8221;</span>

    with this excerpt from the <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/cedarville-students-alumni-question-universitys-di/nWQgS/">Dayton Daily News&#8217; most recent piece on Cedarville</a>:
  </p>
  
  <p style="padding-left:30px;">
    &#8220;Tennessee Pastor Chris Williamson said he resigned from the school’s board of trustees after being “blindsided” by what he called <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">the administration’s “mistreatment” of the vice president for student life, Carl Ruby</span></strong>, a popular 25-year veteran of Cedarville who resigned last month. [&#8230;]
  </p>
  
  <p style="padding-left:30px;">
    &#8220;And then, on Jan. 10, it was announced Ruby would “step down” effective June 30. But his last day on campus was Jan. 15, and hundreds of students showed their support by wearing red and lining his walk from his office to his car. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ruby’s departure was publicly called a resignation. But Williamson said he learned at a January trustees’ meeting, “it was a termination of employment.”</strong></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    and with this excerpt from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/us/a-christian-college-struggles-to-define-itself.html?_r=0">New York Times piece on the Cedarville controversy</a>:
  </p>
  
  <p style="padding-left:30px;">
    &#8220;The Rev. Chris Williamson of Franklin, Tenn., who last month resigned from the Cedarville board of trustees, said that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>both the president and Dr. Ruby were considered problematic by the faction of trustees fearful of what they perceive as a creeping liberalism. “They were threatened by Carl’s approach not to theology but to ministry,”</strong></span> Mr. Williamson said, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“in terms of his ministry to people struggling with gender identification, how he ministers to people on the margins.”</strong></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It would be frustrating enough if it were a secular organization committing these injustices. But to watch an organization which claims the name of Christ behave in such despicable ways? It&#8217;s intolerable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s frustrated by these things: consider Scot <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/02/16/cedarville-the-next-episode/">McKnight</a>, Anthony <a href="http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2012/10/concerning-controversy-related-to.html">LeDonne</a>, <a href="http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2013/02/cedarville-university-controversy.html">LeDonne again</a>, Michael <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/10/michael-pahl-dismissal-from-cedarville-university/">Bird</a>, Mark <a href="http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/michael-pahl-and-disgrace-of-cedarville.html">Goodacre</a>, and James <a href="http://jamesmcgahey.blogspot.com/2012/11/reflections-on-firing-of-michael-pahl.html">McGahey</a>. </strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No, <strong>this does not mean that everyone at Cedarville is dishonest, evil or misguided</strong>. In fact, there are plenty of godly women and men here. Women and men whom I&#8217;d like to defend, because I&#8217;ve seen how stressful and fearful this environment has become for them and their families.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But <strong>it&#8217;s the leadership here I&#8217;m worried about</strong>. And as often as the Bible urges respect for leaders, it holds the leaders of the God&#8217;s people accountable even more so, often with strong language. Don&#8217;t believe me? Go and read the prophets, focusing on their words for the priests and princes of Israel.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>&#8220;There’s nothing more dangerous to the cause of Christ than religious people with an ungodly agenda. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cedarville&src=hash"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><s>#</s>cedarville</span></a>”</strong></span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (<a href="https://twitter.com/gdk_chris">@gdk_chris</a>; 12:49 PM – 1 Feb 13).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I couldn&#8217;t agree more. And that is why <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>I&#8217;m calling the leadership of my University to repent, or to quit claiming to be Christ-centered in these matters.</strong></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    God will not be mocked.
