_(Note: Read more about my work on [Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible here][1].)_

I&#8217;m really looking forward to reading these two Barth (and Bonhoeffer) books coming out from Baker in 2019:

  1. [Freedom under the Word: Karl Barth’s Theological Exegesis][2]. Edited by Ben Rhodes and Martin Westerholm.
  2. [Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Theologians for a Post-Christian World][3]. By Wolf Krötke. Translated by John P. Burgess.

## Freedom under the Word (May 2019)

According to [Baker][4]:

> In _Freedom under the Word_, top-tier scholars offer critical engagements with Karl Barth&#8217;s exegesis of Christian Scripture and explore its implications for contemporary hermeneutics and biblical interpretation. Focusing on rare texts from the Barth corpus, this volume considers the legacy and potential of Barth&#8217;s theology by presenting a wide-ranging engagement with and assessment of Barth&#8217;s theological exegesis. The book covers Barth&#8217;s career chronologically, providing insight into his theological development as it relates to Scripture. _Freedom under the Word_ will benefit professors and students of theology, biblical interpretation, and the theological interpretation of Scripture as well as Barth scholars.

Here are the contents:

## Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (August 2019)

Again, according to [Baker][5]:

> Wolf Krötke, acclaimed as a foremost interpreter of the theologies of Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, demonstrates the continuing significance of these two theologians for Christian faith and life. This book enables readers to look with fresh eyes at the theologies of Barth and Bonhoeffer and offers new insights for reading the history of modern theology. It also helps churches see how they can be creative minorities in societies that have forgotten God.
> 
> Translated by a senior American scholar of Christian theology and an accomplished translator, this is the first major translation of Krötke&#8217;s work in the English language. The book is necessary reading for those studying Barth, Bonhoeffer, and other developments in modern German dogmatics.
