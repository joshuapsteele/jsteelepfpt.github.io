To whomever the following concerns:

**I&#8217;d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University. **

After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.

Many times my frustration &#8211; directed at the nebulous group of trustees and administrators most directly responsible for things like the White Papers, the firing of Michael Pahl, and the firing of Carl Ruby &#8211; has seeped over and negatively affected some of the good people I&#8217;d like to defend and advocate for, if it were their necks on the chopping block.

There are MANY great people at Cedarville University in between those who&#8217;ve been fired and those who&#8217;ve made the firing decisions, and I don&#8217;t want to overlook them or accidentally attack them. If you&#8217;re a member of that group and you&#8217;ve been put-off by my recent words and actions, I truly am sorry. Please forgive me. 

**I&#8217;d also like to apologize publicly for any embarrassment I&#8217;ve caused to the Kingdom of God in this process.**

That is, while I&#8217;m NOT sorry for seeking prophetically to address injustices being committed by the people of God against the people of God, I AM sorry if I&#8217;ve given the impression to those on the outside looking in that this is how Christianity always goes.

(This is not a retraction of my activism efforts, for I am sincerely convinced that the University has committed institutional sins, if you will, in its recent decisions.)

However, I would like to remind all &#8220;outsiders&#8221; that following Jesus of Nazareth is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not</strong> </span>supposed to look like the current controversies which plague Cedarville University. Christianity is more than just intrigue and infighting, although those things will always be a part of Christendom until the end of days because us Christians are messed-up people just like everyone else.

Would you <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>please forgive me, and please forgive us Christians, for doing a poor job of representing Yahweh to you? </strong></span>

He is a God of unity, justice, and peace, and yet far too often we, as his people, miserably fail at embodying those things.

In the end, Yahweh has told us human beings what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. (Micah 6:8.)

Justice, mercy, and humility. 

Please forgive me for when I&#8217;ve failed to embody <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mercy</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">humility</span> in my pursuit of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">justice</span>. 

Sincerely, 

Joshua Steele
