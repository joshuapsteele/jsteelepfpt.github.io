The following checklist, found on pages 155–56 of Alan Jacobs’s excellent book, [_How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds_][1] (affiliate link), is a worthy addition to “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” (mentioned in my previous post, [“Help me come up with ‘rules for conversation’!”][2]).<figure class="wp-block-embed-amazon-kindle wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon">

Emphasis added in **bold**.

  1. **When faced with provocation to respond to what someone has said, give it five minutes**. Take a walk, or weed the garden, or chop some vegetables. Get your body involved: your body knows the rhythms to live by, and if your mind falls into your body&#8217;s rhythm, you&#8217;ll have a better chance of thinking. 
  2. **Value learning over debating**. Don&#8217;t &#8220;talk for victory.&#8221; 
  3. As best you can, online and off, **avoid the people who fan flames**.
  4. Remember that **you don&#8217;t have to respond to what everyone else is responding to in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness**.
  5. **If you _do_ have to respond to what everyone else is responding to** in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness, or else lose your status in your community, then you should realize that **it&#8217;s not a community but rather an [Inner Ring][3]**. 
  6. **Gravitate** as best you can, in every way you can, **toward people who seem to value genuine community and can handle disagreement with equanimity**.
  7. **Seek out the best and fairest-minded of people whose views you disagree with.** Listen to them for a time without responding. Whatever they say, _think it over_.
  8. Patiently, and as honestly as you can, **assess your [repugnances][4]**.
  9. Sometimes **the &#8220;ick factor&#8221;** is telling; sometimes it&#8217;s a distraction from what matters. 
 10. Beware of **metaphors** and **myths** that do too much heavy cognitive lifting; notice what your **&#8220;[terministic screens][5]&#8220;** [See pages 90–91] are directing your attention to-and what they&#8217;re directing your attention _away from_; look closely for hidden metaphors and beware the power of myth.
 11. Try to **describe others&#8217; positions in the language that _they_ use, without indulging in in-other-wordsing.** [See pg. 106: “We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, ‘In other words, you&#8217;re saying &#8230; ‘ And inevitably the argument, when put _in other words_, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked.]
 12. Be **brave**.
