  <p>
    O Loving Father, we commend to your gracious keeping all who are near and dear to us.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have mercy upon any who are sick, and comfort those who are in pain, anxiety, or sorrow.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Awaken all who are careless about eternal things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bless those who are young and in health, that they may give the days of their strength to you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Comfort the aged and infirm, that your peace may rest upon them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hallow the ties of kindred, that we may help and not hinder one another in all the good works that you have prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 
  </p>
