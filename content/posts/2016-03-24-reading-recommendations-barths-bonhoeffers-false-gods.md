Hi internet &#8211; especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.

I&#8217;m in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.

Here&#8217;s my goal: **to explore the possible relationship between Barth&#8217;s critique of the &#8220;No-God&#8221;**(Nich-Gott) **and Bonhoeffer&#8217;s critique(s) of viewing God as a &#8220;stopgap&#8221;** (Lückenbüßer) **or &#8220;working hypothesis.&#8221;**

As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the _Romans_ commentary, [Garrett Green&#8217;s recent re-translation of ][1][_CD_][1] [§17][1], and _Letters and Papers from Prison_.

As for secondary sources, right now I&#8217;m starting the list with [Tom Greggs&#8217; **_Theology Against Religion_**][2]. I&#8217;ve read this twice now, and it has been a major inspiration for the project.

I&#8217;ve also got my eye on [Michael DeJonge&#8217;s **_Bonhoeffer&#8217;s Theological Formation_**,][3] [Ernst Feil&#8217;s **_The Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer_**][4], [Andreas Pangritz&#8217;s **_Karl Barth in the Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer_**][5], and [Jeffrey Pugh&#8217;s **_Religionless Christianity_**][6].

I&#8217;m also working my way through [Sven Ensminger&#8217;s **_Karl Barth&#8217;s Theology as a Resource for a Christian Theology of Religions_**][7]. While this looks very helpful for a larger project on Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the theological critique of religion, **I&#8217;m still looking for sources that deal more directly with Barth&#8217;s &#8220;No-God&#8221; and Bonhoeffer&#8217;s God as &#8220;stopgap&#8221; or &#8220;working hypothesis.&#8221; **

### _**Do you have any reading recommendations for me? **_

OR, even better: Have any of you translated Hans-Joachim Kraus&#8217; _**[Theologische Religionskritik][8]** _into English yet? Because that would be fantastic.
