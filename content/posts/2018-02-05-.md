# Does Your Spiritual Health Depend Upon Your Emotions?

Let&#8217;s face it, we all have room to grow in our spiritual lives. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve often struggled to spend regular time in prayer and reading Scripture.

If you were to graph my spiritual health over time, it would look like a roller coaster. Sometimes, I felt like reading the Bible and praying, so I did. Other times, I didn&#8217;t feel like it, so I didn&#8217;t.

## 1. The Christian Life is About More Than Just Beliefs/Thoughts/Emotions

That&#8217;s right.

## 2. Your Mornings and Evenings Matter (to God)

## 3. The Daily Office Will Expose You to Scripture

## 4. The Daily Office Will Connect You to the Church

## Want to Try the Daily Office? Download the Rookie Anglican Daily Office Booklet

I created the Rookie Anglican Daily Office booklet to solve a particular problem: All Christians could benefit from doing the Daily Office, as I&#8217;ve argued above, but few Christians know how to navigate a Book of Common Prayer in order to do so.

So, I created a resource. With just this Booklet and a Bible, you can join Christians around the world in doing Morning and Evening Prayer.
