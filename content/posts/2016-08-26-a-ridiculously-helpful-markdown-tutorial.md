I&#8217;ve been dragging my heels on learning Markdown for awhile now.

If you don&#8217;t know, Markdown is:

> [lightweight markup language][1] with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to [HTML][2] and many other formats using a tool by the same name.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Markdown is often used to format [readme files][3], for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create [rich text][4] using a [plain text][5] [editor][6]. [Source: [Wikipedia][7]]

That is, get the benefits of HTML and/or rich text, without [as steep of] a learning curve!

To make things even easier, I suggest starting with this [Markdown][8] [Tutorial][8]. Should this tutorial prove too basic, it even links to other, more in-depth guides at the end!

I plan to start implementing Markdown in my workflow for this blog, and also for [Rookie Anglican][9].

Cheers!
