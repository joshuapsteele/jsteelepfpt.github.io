If you&#8217;re interested, here&#8217;s [the latest version of the Regional ETS paper][1] I will present today at 5:00pm at Beeson Divinity School, room S009.

If you&#8217;re able to attend the presentation, that&#8217;s great! If not, feel free to give [my paper][1] a read and get back to me with any questions, comments, or suggestions. Atonement theology and the unity of the Church are two things about which I am very passionate, and intend to devote further study to these areas in the future.

Thanks

~Josh
