I&#8217;m two years in to my PhD program, and I need to finish writing this dissertation soon, or it&#8217;s going to be the death of me!

Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love Wheaton&#8217;s program. My supervisor and second reader are fantastic. And I think that this Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible project is worthwhile.

But I&#8217;ve got a wife, a kid, a commitment to the Church, and I need to move on with my life.

SO, in order to give myself a daily kick in the pants, I&#8217;ve used Stickk.com to commit to writing 500 words OR editing 5 pages (1,250 words), related to my dissertation, 5 days a week.

I got the 5-5-5 idea from [Rebecca Schuman&#8217;s tweet][1]:

> Academics, or anyone who has a long writing project, here is some gratis coaching. The ideal default pace is 5-5-5: 500 words OR 5 pages of editing, 5 days a week. Telling yourself that&#8217;s not enough is essentially giving yourself permission to do nothing. 5-5-5 will get it done. 

If I don&#8217;t achieve this goal each week, $250.00 will go to an &#8220;anti-charity&#8221; of my choice. In this case, I&#8217;ve picked the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation.

I&#8217;d rather my money _not_ go to this organization, so I plan to succeed in my commitment.
