  <span style="color: #000000;">INTRODUCTION: THE NATURE OF SCRIPTURE</span>
</h2>

<span style="color: #000000;">As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illocutionary_act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illocutionary act</a> which testifies to the Son of God<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>1</sup></span></a> as the ultimate redemptive and revelatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locutionary_act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">locution</a> of the the triune God, Scripture is used by the Spirit of God to accomplish the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlocutionary_act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perlocutionary end</a> of redemption<i> of</i>,<i> in</i>, and<i> through</i> the people of God.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>2</sup></span></a> </span>

_[Ahem, in order to understand my first paragraph, you must first be familiar with the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speech Act Theory</a>. If you&#8217;ve never heard of it before, click that link, and then come back here. It will be worth it, I promise!]_

<span style="color: #000000;">The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably <strong>trinitarian</strong> in nature and <strong>ecclesiological</strong> in implication.</span>

(For an explanation of the Trinity, see my essay &#8220;[Trinity: What is it? (Why) Is it important?][1]&#8220;)

<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">
  <span style="color: #000000;">WHAT SCRIPTURE IS FOR CHRISTIANS</span>
</h2>

<span style="color: #000000;">For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit&#8217;s illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible&#8217;s role<i> in</i> and<i> for</i> the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">
  <span style="color: #000000;">How the Bible Came to Be</span>
</h2>

<span style="color: #000000;">Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of<i> canon</i> in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ&#8217;s resurrection and ascension.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or<i> Tanakh</i>, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible’s narrative of YHWH&#8217;s redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the<i> Tanakh</i>, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as “the rule of truth”: the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other.<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible’s true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ<i> according to the Scriptures</i> – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9).<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial “point” of proclamation becomes a “line” throughout history by<i> tradition</i> as “the act of passing down” and “the content of what is passed down.”<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This connection was so strong that he referred to the “traditioned” teachings of the apostles as<i> in scripturis</i>, responding to those who accused these apostolic “Writings” of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles&#8217; teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures).<a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church&#8217;s recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Canon&#8217;s final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church&#8217;s recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the<i> Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle</i> of Athanasius &#8211; the first canon list to include “all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament.”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span>

<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">
  <span style="color: #000000;">Scripture&#8217;s Proper Interpretation and Role</span>
</h2>

<span style="color: #000000;">In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism&#8217;s rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter&#8217;s present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.</span>

<h1 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">
  <span style="color: #000000;">SCRIPTURE&#8217;S OWN AUTHORITY</span>
</h1>

<span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned above, Scripture&#8217;s authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture&#8217;s authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Jesus himself never shied away from claiming that he was the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 5:17; Lk. 24:25-27, 44). Indeed, he chastised the Jewish leaders for thoroughly studying the Scriptures, yet failing to see that the<i> Tanakh</i> bore witness to him (John 5:39-40)! </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, in Acts, Peter (3:11-26), Stephen (7:1-53), and Paul (13:16-41) all portray Christ as the fulfillment of YHWH&#8217;s previous interactions with Israel in the <i>Tanakh</i>. The written Word of God is authoritative in that it bears witness to the Living Word as the zenith of God&#8217;s redemptive revelation – the “image of the invisible God” in whom “the fulness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:15, 19, ESV).</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">When the Bible speaks of its own authority, it never does so apart from the life of the faithful, the Church. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The two favorite passages for the inspiration (and often, the inerrancy) of Scripture both refuse to reduce the Bible to a set of propositions to be debated within a correspondence theory of truth. The Scriptures were “breathed out by God,” not to be profitable for scientific analysis, but for “reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16, ESV). Furthermore, “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,” (2 Pet. 1:21, ESV) for the sake of the people of God, that they might know Christ (2 Pet. 1:12-21). Arguably, then, the ties between inspiration and sanctification are stronger than those between inspiration and certain common notions of inerrancy.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">At this intersection between the inspired illocutionary acts of Scripture and their perlocutionary effects lies the Spirit of God, who empowers the “inscripturate” Word to become “incardiate,” or “taken to heart” by God&#8217;s people.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Pneumatologically, then, the Bible is able both to<i> be</i> and<i> become</i> the Word of God, as its written words are used in various ways by the Spirit throughout the ages to effect God&#8217;s mission of redemption <i>in</i> and <i>through</i> his people.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The christological, ecclesiological, and pneumatological elements of the divine speech-act thus enable the written Word continually to be an indispensable part of divine discourse, instead of a merely static word.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a></span>

<h1 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">
  <span style="color: #000000;">CONCLUSION</span>
</h1>

<span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the ages, God has used his Word – living and written – to do everything from creating the world, to redeeming it; from calling a people, to establishing orthodoxy and orthopraxy in his Church; from inspiring reformation, to drawing people from every tribe, tongue, and nation to himself. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In order best to appropriate the written Word of God and submit to its continuing authority in their lives, the people of God should focus on proclaiming its central message as the Gospel of Jesus Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to accomplish fresh perlocutionary effects<i> in</i> and<i> through</i> them as God&#8217;s redemptive mission moves toward its consummation – when the written Word of God will be in their hearts and the living Word of God in front of their faces, forever (Jer. 31:33-34; Rev. 21-22).</span>

    <a href="#sdfootnote2anc" name="sdfootnote2sym">2</a> I here adopt J.L. Austin&#8217;s speech-act theory, as put forth in How to Do Things with Words (2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). Briggs offers the following helpful summary: “Austin sought to distinguish between the act performed in saying something and the act performed by saying something, labeling these &#8216;illocutionary&#8217; and &#8216;perlocutionary&#8217; acts respectively.” See Richard S. Briggs, “Speech-Act Theory” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 763. I am also heavily indebted to Kevin J. Vanhoozer, “Word of God” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 850-4.
