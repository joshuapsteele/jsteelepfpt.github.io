As of this morning, it looks like everything for [Anglican Compass][1] has been successfully moved over from our HostGator shared hosting to Bluehost VPS hosting.

I&#8217;m hoping that this new arrangement works well for us! Although, to be honest, it&#8217;s still an open question in my mind whether or not managed WordPress hosting with WPEngine would be a better fit. I just can&#8217;t quite tell whether or not it would be worth the extra cost, given our current traffic and budget.

What I would _really_ love is for someone to sit down with me and give me a consultation on whether or not we&#8217;ve got things set up well for the following 3 websites on Bluehost:

  * https://anglicancompass.com/ (this is our most important website right now, it gets the most traffic)
  * http://www.leaderworks.org/
  * https://theevergreenproject.org/

Until now, I&#8217;ve only been involved with the backend of [Anglican Compass][1], so I&#8217;m not really sure of the ins and outs of how the other 2 websites are set up on the backend. But these three projects are going to be associated going forward, and I&#8217;d like to make sure that we&#8217;re set up for future success as our numbers increase!
