Have you ever had a problem finding a reliable resource for recommendations?

I have.

Certain Google searches are a piece of cake, but the &#8220;best resources for \___\___&#8221; ones can be hit-or-miss.

And don&#8217;t even get me started on the [decision fatigue][1].  As a serial over-thinker, I start to hate myself a little bit after reading through the upteenth list of &#8220;5 Best \____s.&#8221; It makes it so hard to make a decision! Then, when you pick something, you end up doubting your decision. Not fun.

I&#8217;m sure these dynamics apply to a bunch of different things in life. However, while serving as a Youth Minister in seminary, I realized that finding reliable Christian recommendations and resources can be very difficult.

Sure, it&#8217;s not for lack of content out there! When it comes to Christianity, everyone has an opinion &#8211; and usually an associated reading list!

But how do you know that the book or blog-post that you find isn&#8217;t from some crazy yahoo with nothing more than a computer and a Bible?

Furthermore, if you&#8217;re a Christian and your looking for recommendations and resources in some _other _area, how do you know that what you find is worthwhile?

I mean, sure, _everything _should be read with a critical eye. But is that latest book or blog-post about mindfulness, parenting, self-help, or productivity helpful and useful for Christians? Or will it require quite a bit of theological critique and analysis before it&#8217;s helpful without being potentially harmful?

Google is great, and getting better at many things. But &#8211; at least for right now &#8211; it&#8217;s a pretty crappy theologian!

With all this in mind, I have an idea: _**The Well-Equipped Christian**_ (or a similar title) &#8211; a website that&#8217;s a one-stop shop for Christians looking for reliable recommendations and resources.

Now, to be clear, I&#8217;m not claiming to BE the well-equipped Christian! I am not the be-all-end-all source of reliable Christian information.

However, I am a Christian with a seminary education. I&#8217;m pursuing a PhD in theology, and I have a heart for the Church.

I want to devote my life and ministry to helping to produce as many &#8220;well-equipped Christians&#8221; as possible. And I absolutely **love** giving practical recommendations &#8211; specifically in the areas of Bible study, theology, productivity, and [meta-learning][2].

There are a lot of great resources out there. Resources that Christians can benefit from to have healthy **minds**, **bodies**, and **souls** as they advance God&#8217;s Kingdom in their daily lives.

I want to connect you to those resources.

Are you wiling to help me figure out whether or not this is a good idea? If so, great! **I&#8217;d love to hear your answers to the following questions:**

  1. **What is the biggest problem that you&#8217;ve faced in finding reliable recommendations and resources?** Not just for specifically Christian resources (although that&#8217;s great if you want to focus on that), but also for resources in general.
  2. **When you talk to your friends about finding reliable recommendations and resources, what kinds of things do you say?** Any specific feelings or complaints?

Finally, please share this post with anyone you think would be willing to give me their input! Thank you so much!
