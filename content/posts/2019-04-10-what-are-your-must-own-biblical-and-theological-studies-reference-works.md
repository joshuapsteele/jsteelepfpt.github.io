It just happened again. I had to consult [&#8220;BDAG,&#8221; A Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed.)][1].

I don&#8217;t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think &#8220;I really should buy this.&#8221; But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG&#8217;s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I&#8217;ve held off.

Nevertheless, I&#8217;m seeking to build my &#8220;must-have&#8221; personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian. So, I think I need to buy BDAG sometime soon. While I&#8217;m at it, I might as well get HALOT, the Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament&#8230; [Logos sells them as a bundle][2].

Might as well get the [IVP Bible Dictionaries][3], too. I own hard copies of Prophets and Jesus and the Gospels, but I could use NT Background, Paul and His Letters, Historical Books, Pentateuch, and Wisdom, Poetry and Writings&#8230;

How far does the list of &#8220;must-have&#8221; reference works go?

I&#8217;m currently a Ph.D. student in theology, but my project is integrative across the biblical-theological studies divide (Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible). So, I need to have both my Bible and my theology bases covered, both now as a Ph.D. student and in the future as a &#8220;pastor theologian.&#8221;

What reference works in biblical and theological studies are your &#8220;must-owns&#8221;?
