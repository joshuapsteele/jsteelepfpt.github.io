Join Fr. David and Fran Roseberry  on a trip custom designed to introduce pastors to the rich history of Christianity in England. The tour will begin in London where they will tour all the traditional landmarks, but dedicate special time to Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral.

&#8220;From there, we will tour Canterbury with its famous cathedral to which millions have made pilgrimage, as well as St. Augustine’s Abbey and St. Martin’s Church, the oldest church in continual use in the English-speaking world.

Cambridge offers not only a rich history of scholarship, but also the unparalleled architectural wonder of King’s College Chapel, with its soaring ceilings and delicate stained-glass. After a special service there, we will enjoy a walking tour of this beautiful town, visiting Trinity College and Ely Cathedral as well.

Departing Cambridge, we will look back into the deep history of England as we visit Lincoln Cathedral, commissioned by William the Conqueror in the 11th century. We will then spend the evening in picturesque Leeds before a day of museum visits and cultural engagements in Newcastle.

The highlight for many clergy is a visit to Oxford, the home of some of the most pivotal figures and moments in the history of the church. Pause and reflect in Martyr’s Square, visit Christ Church College, stroll the famed walk by Magdalene College where C.S. Lewis often paced, and bend an elbow at one of the several pubs frequented by Lewis, Tolkien, and the rest of ‘the Inklings.’

This trip will deepen your faith and heighten your appreciation for the history of the church. [Learn more by clicking here][1]—then join us!
