I&#8217;m scared. Are you?

Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:

> I&#8217;m scared &#8211; I&#8217;m scared of wasting my life, I&#8217;m scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.

Fear drives so many aspects of our lives &#8211; from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we&#8217;re honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.

For example, perhaps we worship God out of a fear of going to hell, or a fear of our inherited religion being wrong. We secretly worry that, like Donald Miller&#8217;s father accuses him in the movie [Blue Like Jazz][1], we &#8220;_**only believe that stuff &#8216;cuz [we]&#8217;re afraid to hang out with people that don&#8217;t**_.&#8221;

Or perhaps we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don&#8217;t</span> worship God &#8211; and instead worship a god of our choice/invention &#8211; because we&#8217;re afraid of the implications of God&#8217;s existence.

Now, there is, I&#8217;m persuaded, a holy fear. A salutary reverence and awe in the face of the divine.

But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about here, I&#8217;m talking about the _**paralyzing**_ fear &#8211; the cold sweat, the white knuckles, the tension headaches.

I&#8217;m talking about the same kind of fear as [Seth Godin][2]:

Courage isn&#8217;t the absence of fear. It&#8217;s knowing how to deal with fear. And, for me, **the first step toward dealing with my fears is frankly admitting them. **

  * I&#8217;m scared, because I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s next after I graduate from [Beeson][3] in December.
  * I&#8217;m scared, because the thing I&#8217;ve felt called to for the longest time &#8211; getting a PhD in systematic theology &#8211; seems like an impractical pipe dream.
  * I&#8217;m scared, because I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll get into a PhD program. And, if I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll react to not being able to rely upon good grades for self-worth.

Thankfully, none of these fears prevent me from being faithful with the day I&#8217;ve been given &#8211; today. **The greatest failure would be to use fears of the future as an excuse for present faithlessness**.

### So, what are you afraid of? How are you dealing with those fears?

### Have you admitted them to anyone? If not, I challenge you to do so today.

If you&#8217;ve got no one, not even a journal, to listen to your admission, I&#8217;m all ears, for what it&#8217;s worth.
