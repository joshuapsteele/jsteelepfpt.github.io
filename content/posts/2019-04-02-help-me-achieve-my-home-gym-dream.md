I&#8217;m trying to put together a basic home gym in our basement apartment. Mainly, I&#8217;m interested in doing squats for now. Then, I&#8217;ll expand to deadlifts and benchpress. Our ceilings are too low for overhead presses, however.

Anyways, I just ordered the Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack from Amazon.

I still need a decent Olympic bar and Olympic plates.
