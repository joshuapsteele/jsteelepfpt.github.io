I&#8217;m reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong&#8217;s excellent book, [_Think Again: How to Reason and Argue_][1].

In it (on pages 25–26), I came across [&#8220;Rapoport&#8217;s Rules.&#8221;][2]

First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett ([_Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking_][3], 31–35), here they are:

> 1: You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, &#8220;Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.&#8221;
> 
> 2: You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
> 
> 3: You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
> 
> 4: Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism. 

How would our conversations—everything from family dinner to classroom discussions to church business meetings—look different if we put these rules into practice?
