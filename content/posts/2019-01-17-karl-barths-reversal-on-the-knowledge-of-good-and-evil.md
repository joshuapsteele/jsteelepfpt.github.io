I argue that, although Barth’s interpretation of the Genesis passages changed between [_The Epistle to the Romans_][1] and the [_Church Dogmatics_][2], his mature readings of Genesis 2–3 still support his overall theological critique of religion as idolatry, the self-justifying positing of false gods.

Specifically, in _Romans_ (240–57, esp. 246–51), Barth interpreted “the knowledge of good and evil” as the divine secret that humans are merely humans.

  * The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby concealed the creator/creature distinction 
  * and was meant to enable a direct relationship between God and humans. 
  * Instead, human disobedience revealed the distinction 
  * and led to the rise of religion as worship of God, an independent action over against their creator. 

In the _Church Dogmatics_ (esp. CD III/1, 257–76, but also IV/1, 418–78), Barth interpreted the knowledge of good and evil as God’s prerogative to judge between what ought to be and what ought not to be.

  * The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby revealed the creator/creature distinction 
  * and was meant to prompt humans to acknowledge and praise their creator—to worship God in a proper way.
  * Instead, humans disobediently attempted to abolish the distinction.
  * This led to the rise of religion as improper worship—the self-exalting, self-justifying, and self-helping positing of false gods.
