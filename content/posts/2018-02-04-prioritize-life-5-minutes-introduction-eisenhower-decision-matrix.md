If you&#8217;re reading this blog post, I imagine that you, like me, are pretty busy. You&#8217;ve got a lot on your mind, a lot on your to-do list, and you&#8217;re not sure how to prioritize your time and attention to the things that really matter.

Having introduced the [80/20 Rule (also known as the Pareto Principle, &#8220;law of the vital few,&#8221; etc.)][1], I&#8217;d like to now introduce you to its powerful partner: The Eisenhower Decision Matrix.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_Eisenhower_Box_is_worth_your_time_because_it_will_help_you_to_perform_an_8020_Analysis_on_your_life"></span>The Eisenhower Box is worth your time because it will help you to [perform an 80/20 Analysis on your life][1].<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

That is, it will help you zero-in on the &#8220;vital few&#8221; &#8211; the top 20% or so of your tasks, habits, etc. that are responsible for 80% of the positive outcomes in your life.

It will also help you to see the &#8220;worst few&#8221; &#8211; the bottom 20% of tasks, habits, etc. that are neither important nor urgent.

Put simply, the Eisenhower Decision Matrix will help you to get a clear view of your priorities. If you use it and act upon it, it will help you to manage your time more effectively.

# <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Introducing_the_Eisenhower_Decision_Matrix_AKA_The_Eisenhower_Box"></span>Introducing the Eisenhower Decision Matrix (AKA &#8220;The Eisenhower Box&#8221;)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41027" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MerrillCoveyMatrix.png" alt="Eisenhower Decision Matrix" width="422" height="433" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MerrillCoveyMatrix.png 422w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MerrillCoveyMatrix-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /> 

First, let&#8217;s answer a potential question.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_is_it_named_after_Eisenhower"></span>Why is it named after Eisenhower?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Great question! To be honest, this method/tool isn&#8217;t universally attributed to Eisenhower (for example, in my 1989 edition of Stephen R. Covey&#8217;s classic, _<a href="http://amzn.to/2GMmG1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> _[affiliate link], Covey doesn&#8217;t mention Eisenhower, though he discusses the tool under Habit 3: Put First Things First).

However, the tool is widely named after Eisenhower, because of an unverified quote that is often attributed to Eisenhower. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard it before:

> **What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.**

* * *

# <span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Use_the_Eisenhower_Decision_Matrix"></span>How to Use the Eisenhower Decision Matrix<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

What you will need: **Paper** and a **Pen(cil)**. (See my [Resources][2] page for my favorite notebook and pen recommendations.)

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="1_Perform_a_Brain_Dump_-_Write_Down_All_The_Things_You_Spend_Your_Time_On"></span>1. Perform a &#8220;Brain Dump&#8221; &#8211; Write Down All The Things You Spend Your Time On<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

That&#8217;s right, just take a blank page and start writing down any and everything that you can think of that you spend time on. This can include specific items on your to-do list, but also more general things like &#8220;grocery shopping,&#8221; &#8220;doing laundry,&#8221; or &#8220;scrolling through Facebook.&#8221;

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="2_Draw_a_Large_Blank_Eisenhower_Box_and_Fill_It_In"></span>2. Draw a Large, Blank Eisenhower Box, and Fill It In<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41027" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MerrillCoveyMatrix.png" alt="Eisenhower Decision Matrix" width="422" height="433" srcset="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MerrillCoveyMatrix.png 422w, https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MerrillCoveyMatrix-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /> 

Again, here&#8217;s what a basic Eisenhower Box looks like. Draw a blank one on a sheet of paper. (Probably a separate sheet of paper if you&#8217;ve surfaced a lot of things in your &#8220;Brain Dump&#8221;!)

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Whats_Important_Whats_Urgent"></span>What&#8217;s Important? What&#8217;s Urgent?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

  * **IMPORTANT**: this item contributes to your purpose, goals, mission, values in life, etc.
  * **URGENT**: there is a pressing reason why you need to take care of this item SOONER rather than LATER!

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Decide_What_Goes_in_Each_Quadrant"></span>How to Decide What Goes in Each Quadrant<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

If you have a hard time filling in all four quadrants of the Eisenhower box at a time, don&#8217;t worry! This gets easier with practice.

Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to what you should do if you find filling out the box difficult:

  * First, ask yourself for each item from your brain dump: **Is this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">important</span> or not? Is this making a meaningful contribution to my life?**
  * Then, separate the items into two categories: **Important** and **Unimportant**.
  * Take a look at each of the **Important** items and ask: **Is this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">urgent</span> or not? Is there a pressing reason I need to take care of this now/soon?**
  * Separate the Important items into two categories: **Important/Urgent** and **Important/Non-Urgent**.
  * Place the Important/Urgent items into **Quadrant 1**, the top-left corner of the Eisenhower Box.
  * Place the Important/Non-Urgent items into **Quadrant 2**, the top-right corner of the Eisenhower Box.
  * Now, take a look at each of the **Unimportant** items you listed and ask: **Is this urgent or not?**
  * Separate the Unimportant items into two categories: **Unimportant/Urgent** and **Unimportant/Non-Urgent**.
  * Place the Unimportant/Urgent items into **Quadrant 3**, the bottom-left corner.
  * Place the Unimportant/Non-Urgent items into **Quadrant 4**, the bottom-right corner.

Voila! You&#8217;ve now filled-out your very first Eisenhower Matrix!

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="3_Prioritize_Your_Time_Accordingly"></span>3. Prioritize Your Time Accordingly<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

It might not seem like it now, but that completed box is actually a POWERFUL time management tool, if you&#8217;re willing to use it. Here&#8217;s how.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Quadrant_1_ImportantUrgent_Take_Care_of_These_Things_As_Soon_As_Possible"></span>Quadrant 1 (Important/Urgent): Take Care of These Things As Soon As Possible<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

There&#8217;s no getting around it, the tasks/items in Quadrant 1 need to be taken care of, and they need to be taken care of soon. So, take care of them! These tasks should go on your to-do list. The quicker you can deal with what&#8217;s in Quadrant 1, the quicker you can get to Quadrant 2, which is where you want to spend most of your time (that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s highlighted in yellow in the pictures above, by the way).

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Quadrant_2_ImportantNon-Urgent_Spend_More_Time_on_These_Things"></span>Quadrant 2 (Important/Non-Urgent): Spend More Time on These Things<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

In 80/20 terms, Quadrant 2 contains you&#8217;re top 20% of tasks, habits, etc. Although they&#8217;re not urgent, like Quadrant 1 or Quadrant 3, that&#8217;s actually the key to their long-term importance. These things in Quadrant 2 will have an outsized impact on the rest of your life.

**You, therefore, should structure your life to spend as much time as possible in Quadrant 2. **

This would include things like:

  * Prayer & Scripture
  * Goal Setting
  * Planning
  * Scheduling
  * Healthy Diet
  * Exercise

Of course, this requires a bunch of other skills, such as the ability to schedule, delegate, say &#8220;no&#8221; to things, etc. But, as a first step, it&#8217;s helpful to have Quadrant 2 in mind, so that you know what to shoot for.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Quadrant_3_UnimportantUrgent_Spend_Less_Time_on_or_Delegate_These_Things"></span>Quadrant 3 (Unimportant/Urgent): Spend Less Time on or Delegate These Things<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

In my personal opinion, Quadrant 3 is the most complicated to handle. After all, these tasks are important to _somebody_ out there, otherwise, they wouldn&#8217;t be considered &#8220;urgent.&#8221; So, you can&#8217;t always just delete Quadrant 3 tasks from your life with little consequence (otherwise they would be in Quadrant 4).

Common Quadrant 3 tasks include:

  * Email
  * Meetings
  * Phonecalls/TXTs

So, I agree with the advice of many others out there that you should seek to DELEGATE as many tasks as possible in Quadrant 3. Your goal should be to shrink Quadrant 3 and devote that extra time to Quadrant 2.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Quadrant_4_UnimportantNon-Urgent_Stop_Doing_Most_Of_These_Things"></span>Quadrant 4 (Unimportant/Non-Urgent): Stop Doing (Most Of) These Things<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Finally, Quadrant 4. If you&#8217;re like me, you found the following in this category:

  * Facebook
  * Instagram
  * Twitter
  * Netflix

Most people advise that you **DELETE** these tasks, habits, etc. from your life. And, they have a good point: these things, by your own admission, are neither important nor urgent!

However, I DO think that there is a place for at least _some _recreational Quadrant 4 activities in a life well-lived. After all, the Bible teaches us that rest/Sabbath is important for the Christian life. We&#8217;re not designed to be productive robots who don&#8217;t know how to relax and enjoy the good gifts God gives us. Psalm 127:1-2 comes to mind:

> <span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> builds the house,</span>  
> <span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Ps-127-1">the builders labor in vain.</span></span>  
> <span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> watches over the city,</span>  
> <span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Ps-127-1">the guards stand watch in vain.</span></span>  
> <span id="en-NIV-16124" class="text Ps-127-2">In vain you rise early</span>

That being said, you should only spend time on Quadrant 4 activities if you could, on that occasion, honestly place them under &#8220;healthy rest and relaxation&#8221; in Quadrant 2.
