I&#8217;ll keep this short, sweet, and to the point: **I&#8217;m looking for problems that I can help solve, so I need you to rant at me in the comments.**

That&#8217;s right, I basically want you to complain to me in the comments section of this post.

  * What&#8217;s causing you frustration, angst, or stress these days?
  * What questions are you struggling to find the answers to?
  * What obstacles are in the way of you achieving your goals?

Here&#8217;s MY problem/frustration: **I don&#8217;t know what problems are causing YOU the most friction!**

I don&#8217;t feel like wasting my time researching and writing about things that only _I_ care about.

So, help me help you: Leave me a comment below and tell me what&#8217;s frustrating you.

Think it&#8217;s too random? Unrelated to what I&#8217;d be interested in? Try me.

If I can&#8217;t help you solve your problem/frustration, I can help you find someone who can.

So, what are you waiting for? Rant at me in the comments!

(Or, if it&#8217;s a more private matter, send me an email. Put &#8220;joshua,&#8221; then the @ symbol, then joshuapsteele.com and voila! You&#8217;ve got my email address.)
