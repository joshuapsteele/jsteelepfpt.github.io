## Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m up to these days

> “I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.” ~ Bilbo Baggins in _The Fellowship of the Ring._ 

  * Feeling like I&#8217;ve said &#8220;yes&#8221; to too many commitments over the past 2 years.
  * Looking for things I can say &#8220;no&#8221; to, in order to free up more time to finish my dissertation/Ph.D. and move on to full-time pastoral ministry!

### School

  * I will be taking a course on &#8220;Aquinas on Knowing God&#8221; with Matthew Levering at Mundelein Seminary this Fall. My last required course!

### Church

  * Preparing to take over as point person for our &#8220;Intercessory Prayer Team&#8221; this summer.
  * Looking for better ways to coordinate pastoral care with our church management software, [Breeze ChMS][1].
  * Waiting on a scheduled date for my ordination to the priesthood in 2019.
  * I also: 
      * serve liturgically as a Deacon
      * volunteer with the youth group
      * am the point person for the church&#8217;s website and church management software
      * help lead worship occasionally
      * preach occasionally

### Work: [Managing Editor of Anglican Pastor][2]

  * Preparing to represent Anglican Pastor at the ACNA Provincial Assembly this June in Plano, TX
  * Developing a Job Board for the website
  * Developing Rookie Anglican booklets to give away and/or sell
  * Writing
  * Editing
  * Handling correspondence for the website

### Life

  * Enjoying spending time with my wife, Rachel, and my baby daughter (born 2018-07-20), Eva.
