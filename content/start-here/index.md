# The Problem: Everyone Loves a Good Story, But Few People Live One

Absolutely everyone wants to live a meaningful life &#8211; to live a good story.

So why do so _few_ of us feel like our lives have purpose?! Instead of a meaningful narrative, life seems like a series of random (at best) or unfortunate (at worst) events.

Yet, we all have a sneaking suspicion that things ought to be different, that there ought to be a greater sense of purpose, direction, and significance out there &#8211; something that can shape our chaotic series of events into a meaningful and beautiful story.

What if I told you that things _could_ be different?

# The Solution: Living The Good Story

I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re doomed to the meaningless chaos and stress of our day-to-day lives.

No, instead, I believe that the answer to our &#8220;living a good story&#8221; problem is to learn how to live THE Good Story &#8211; the story of who God is and what God is up to in the world.

Do you realize what this means? **You don&#8217;t have to give your own life meaning.** Instead, your life is already meaningful. The world around you, chaotic and stressful though it is, is already significant. All we need are eyes to see it.

We&#8217;ve lost our story, but we can find it again. We can learn it again. We can live it again.

# If this vision resonates with you, consider hiring me as your coach!

Here&#8217;s what that process looks like.

## First, Schedule Your FREE Coaching Session

Using the form below, contact me to schedule a **FREE** 60-minute coaching session, to see if I&#8217;d be a good fit for you as a life coach.

## Second, Answer These 8 Questions

As a part of our email conversation, I will ask you to answer the following 8 questions before our first coaching conversation.

  1. Give me as much detail as you can about what you consider to be your **life purpose**. What were you put on this earth to do?
  2. How well do your **current roles** in life align with your purpose and strengths?
  3. What are some **dreams** you&#8217;d like to pursue in the next five years?
  4. **What is most important** to you in your life?
  5. List your **top 5 strengths and your top 3 weaknesses**.
  6. Fill in the blank: &#8220;The **problems or challenges** I most want to overcome right now are: \___\____.&#8221;
  7. Fill in the blank: &#8220;The **tangible outcome** I want from being coached is: \___\____.&#8221;

## Third, Enjoy Your First Free Coaching Conversation

In this first FREE 60-minute session, we&#8217;ll discuss:  
&#8211; Your story  
&#8211; Why you&#8217;re interested in pursuing coaching  
&#8211; What change(s) you&#8217;d like to make in your life  
&#8211; What obstacles are getting in the way of those changes  
&#8211; What you&#8217;re looking for in a coach  
&#8211; What to expect from me as your coach

## Finally, Decide Whether or Not You Want Me to Coach You

At the end of our free 60-minute conversation, I&#8217;ll ask you **if you&#8217;re ready and willing to start a paid coaching relationship**.

### Here&#8217;s what a paid coaching relationship costs:

  * **$60.00** for an _Ã  la carte_ 60-minute coaching conversation
  * **$300.00** for six (6) 60-minute coaching conversations, once every two (2) weeks, over the course of three (3) months

_IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are unsatisfied with the paid coaching you receive, I will either give you your money back or work with you to provide the value you&#8217;re looking for._

### In our FIRST paid coaching session, we will focus on:

  * Zeroing-in on a **SMART** (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-specific) **goal** that you are highly motivated to achieve
  * Developing concrete **action steps** for you to take before our next conversation

### After that, here&#8217;s what a TYPICAL coaching session looks like:

  * At the scheduled time, you call me
  * We talk about the most significant, pressing, or interesting thing going on in your life that week
  * You give me a progress report on the action steps you committed to
  * We discuss any action steps that require follow-up steps
  * We return to your overarching goal(s) in order to develop further action steps, moving from what you _could_ do, to what you _would_ do, to what you _will_ do!
  * We review the action steps you&#8217;re committing to
  * Finally, after the phone call, you&#8217;ll send me an email containing (1) your new action steps, written out in your own words and (2) suggested times for our next coaching conversation
