  * Saturday, November 2, 2019, at 5:00 pm.
  * First Presbyterian Church (715 North Carlton Street Wheaton, IL 60187).
  * Anglican Clergy: **WHITE** stoles (All Saints&#8217; takes precedence over the normal red for ordinations).

## Want to get me something as an ordination gift?

_You don&#8217;t have to! Seriously._ But here are some ideas, if you&#8217;re interested.

  * (I&#8217;m all set on Bibles. I would rather you buy someone else a Bible!)
  * I could still use [a red chasuble and stole][1].
  * To complete my travel Holy Communion kit, I could use 
      * [a holy water sprinkler][2] and 
      * [a portable priest stole][3]. 
  * I&#8217;ve got books like _A Priest&#8217;s Handbook_ and the _Book of Occasional Services_, but I could still use a copy of _[Lesser Feasts and Fasts][4]_.
  * Mainly for my required reading in the doctoral program at Wheaton, [I intend to buy these books sometime soon][5].
  * I&#8217;m always on the lookout for **books/resources that will be useful in my ministry as a pastor-theologian**. If you&#8217;ve got one in mind, send it my way!
  * I&#8217;m looking to build my library of biblical and theological resources within Logos Bible Software. You could **[get me a Logos Gift Card][6]**, so I could work on obtaining resources like the following:
      * [Commentaries from the NICOT and NICNT series][7].
      * [Commentaries from the WBC series][8].
      * The [Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary][9]
      * The [Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church][10]
      * The [New Dictionary of Biblical Theology][11]
      * The [Dictionary of Historical Theology][12]
