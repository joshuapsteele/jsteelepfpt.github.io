    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This summer, I’ve spent most of my reading/writing time working on a paper on Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 10. This paper is for the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium, and it has taken <em>way</em> longer than I originally anticipated.</p>
<p>Will I get to use this paper in my dissertation? I’m not sure.</p>
<p>At first, I got excited, because, in my work on Genesis 1–3 last school year, I discovered some differences in how Barth and Bonhoeffer handled Genesis 1–3 vis-a-vis the subsequent history of Israel. Namely, while <em>Barth</em> takes care to work his way from Eden to the Church only after moving through the history of Israel and Jesus, <em>Bonhoeffer</em> jumps right from Eden to the Church via Christ. This difference in what I’m provisionally calling “Christological immediacy”—which is perhaps a confessional one that parallels some of the exegetical differences between Calvin and Luther—has me wondering whether Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in important ways on Israel.</p>
<p>If so, then perhaps a chapter devoted to their readings of Romans 9–11 would be in order! However, while Barth wrote about Romans 9–11 at least three different times (<em>Römerbrief</em>, <em>Shorter Commentary</em>, <em>CD</em> II/2), the closest that Bonhoeffer came to a lengthy exegesis of the passage was in his “Exposition on Romans 9–11 (Student Notes), Finkenwalde, September 28, 1935” (DBWE 14:868ff.). All we have are the following student notes:</p>

<p>So, quite a bit less to go on than Barth’s handful of lengthy expositions of Romans 9–11!</p>
<p>And yet, Bonhoeffer did preach a sermon on Romans 11:6 (“But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace”) while he was in Barcelona (“Sermon on Romans 11:6, Barcelona, Oculi, March 11, 1928,” DBWE 10:480ff.).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, in a letter to his friend Walter Dreß, he wrote:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And, before the sermon, Bonhoeffer had written in his diary:</p>

<p>Regarding this diary entry and the subsequent sermon, Reinhart Staats wrote (in the Editor’s Afterword to the German Edition of DBWE 10):</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, perhaps there’s more going on with Romans 9–11 than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Of course, as far as Barth’s theological critique of religion goes, Romans 7 is more central than Romans 9–11. But, again, Bonhoeffer doesn’t have much to say about Romans 7, at least not in the form of a lengthy exposition. Nevertheless, for both Romans 7 and 9–11, Bonhoeffer might just have enough scattered mentions of the passages to make an interesting comparison of his and Barth’s exegesis of those passages possible.</p>
<p>The search continues!</p>
