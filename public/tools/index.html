<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is my “desert island” pen. It may not be the very best pen in the whole wide world, but I’m quite sure it’s the pen at the intersection of durability, versatility, and affordability.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If you really want to, you can <a href="http://clickypost.com/blog/2015/2/1/how-to-hack-the-zebra-f-701">“hack” the F701 by putting in a better ink cartridge</a>. But I’ve been perfectly happy with the standard Zebra refills.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use this notebook for a personal combination of the <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a> method, <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> journaling, and the <a href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal">5-Minute Journal</a>. It’s a step up, paper-wise from a Moleskine, yet still affordable – and I love the Medium/A5 size. Currently, I’m on my third one, which is “anthracite gray.” The first two were black, then navy blue. I prefer dotted pages, but they also have ruled and blank page options.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>In case you don’t already have and use a password manager, you should really really get one. But don’t just take my word for it, here’s an informative piece from Wired about <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/01/you-need-a-password-manager/">why you need a password manager</a>.</p>
<p>I started using LastPass a couple years back, and I haven’t looked back. My wife and I both share a premium account – installed on our internet browsers and phones.</p>

<p><a href="https://evernote.com/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I use Evernote primarily as my all-in-one digital file-cabinet – my “second brain,” as the company itself calls it. I’ve been paying for a premium subscription for awhile now, but the free version is quite robust and worth checking out. As far as <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/02/08/4-effective-strategies-to-organize-evernote/">organizing my Evernotes goes</a>, I’m currently using <a href="https://michaelhyatt.com/evernote-tags.html">Michael Hyatt’s tag-based system</a>, although I started off just using notebooks and stacks of notebooks.</p>

Therefore, in order to keep track of everything I have to get done, I have found an external task management system absolutely indispensable. I&amp;#8217;ve tried a TON of different task managers, but Todoist has been my favorite for awhile now.

I prefer having an actual watch on my wrist (and, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-every-guy-should-wear-a-watch-2016-1">according to Business Insider</a>, I’m not alone), so that I don’t have to take my phone out of my pocket to check the time. Granted, I don’t have a favorite watch for females. And, granted, there are much nicer, more elaborate, more expensive watches available out there. However, much like my pen choice above, this watch stands at the intersection of functionality, durability, and affordability. If you’re looking for an even cheaper analog option, check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Casio Men’s MQ24-7B2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (recommended by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kevin Kelly via Cool Tools<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="best-tool-for-podcasts-overcast14"><a href="https://overcast.fm/">BEST TOOL FOR PODCASTS: Overcast</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://overcast.fm/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>I think that – after books – podcasts are one of the best ways out there to learn and stay interesting. Plus, unlike books (and Youtube videos), you can easily listen to a podcast while doing something else, such as washing the dishes or folding laundry. Apple’s native Podcasts app has come a very long way, and is worth checking out. However, my favorite podcast app is currently (the free version of) Overcast. To get all “meta” on you, here’s <a href="http://www.thepodcastproducers.com/episode-1">an excellent podcast episode about podcasting</a>. Check it out if you’re even somewhat confused about what podcasts are.</p>
<p>(If you’re curious, here’s <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/my-favorite-podcasts/">a list of my favorite podcasts</a>.)</p>

<p>Just like the pen and the watch recommended above, this is NOT the nicest knife in the world. However, it is functional, durable, and VERY affordable. Pick one up at/via Harbor Freight Tools.</p>
<h1 id="best-tool-for-learningmemory-anki-flashcard-software18"><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">BEST TOOL FOR LEARNING/MEMORY: Anki (Flashcard Software)</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This is the tool I wish I knew about back in high school. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced repetition</a> is a key to successful and time-efficient learning. And Anki bakes spaced repetition into flashcard reviews. I started using Anki, on the recommendation of <a href="http://amzn.to/2tmQ2MP">Gabriel Wyner’s <em>Fluent Forever</em></a>, to learn German for my PhPh.D.rogram. However, the uses of Anki are virtually endless when it comes to learning. Granted, the learning curve is a bit steep, but check out <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/chapter2/">Wyner’s guide to using Anki</a> as a way of getting started.</p>
<p>(Note: as I mention in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/my-favorite-podcasts/">my list of favorite podcasts</a>, Coffee Break German (and <a href="https://radiolingua.com/">Radio Lingua’s other Coffee Break language courses</a>) are also great language-learning tools!)</p>
<h1 id="honorable-mentions-other-tools-worth-trying">Honorable Mentions: Other Tools Worth Trying</h1>
<p>I’lll do my best to periodically update this list of recommendations.</p>
