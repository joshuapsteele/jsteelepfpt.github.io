<p>Since we got married in 2012, Rachel has worked full-time (first as a Registered Nurse, and then as a Family Nurse Practitioner), making many sacrifices so that I could be a full-time student (first as a seminarian, and then as a doctoral student).</p>

<p>I want to serve the world by serving the church as a pastor-theologian. I need to finish my dissertation, and I’d like to continue to serve as the Managing Editor of Anglican Pastor.</p>
<p>But I also need to provide (health insurance!) for my family.</p>
