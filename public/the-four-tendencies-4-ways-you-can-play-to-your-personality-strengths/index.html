<p>So, I thought I would take a few minutes to share it with you.</p>
<h1 id="gretchen-rubin-explains-the-four-tendencies">Gretchen Rubin Explains the Four Tendencies</h1>
<p>First, here’s a six-minute video of Gretchen herself explaining the Four Tendencies and their relevance to changing one’s habits.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-you-respond-to-inner-expectations-and-outer-expectations">How do you respond to INNER EXPECTATIONS and OUTER EXPECTATIONS?</h1>
<p>This is the key question that drives the framework. Here are the possible answers.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-readily-meet-both-inner-and-outer-expectations-you8217re-an-8220upholder8221">If you READILY MEET BOTH INNER AND OUTER EXPECTATIONS, you’re an “UPHOLDER”</h2>
<p>Here’s Gretchen Rubin specifically talking about Upholders, her own tendency.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-readily-meet-inner-expectations-and-resist-outer-expectations-you8217re-a-8220questioner8221">If you READILY MEET INNER EXPECTATIONS and RESIST OUTER EXPECTATIONS, you’re a “QUESTIONER”</h2>
<p>This is what I am. Questioners basically turn all expectations into <em>inner</em> expectations!</p>
<p>Here’s Gretchen talking about Questioners.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-readily-meet-outer-expectations-and-resist-inner-expectations-you8217re-an-8220obliger8221">If you READILY MEET OUTER EXPECTATIONS and RESIST INNER EXPECTATIONS, you’re an “OBLIGER”</h2>
<p>Here’s Gretchen talking about Obligers.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-resist-both-inner-and-outer-expectations-you8217re-a-8220rebel8221">If you RESIST BOTH INNER AND OUTER EXPECTATIONS, you’re a “REBEL”</h2>
<p>Here’s Gretchen talking about Rebels.</p>
<h1 id="so-which-tendency-are-you-if-you8217re-not-sure-take-this-free-quiz">So, which tendency are you? If you’re not sure, take this free quiz!</h1>
<p>Gretchen Rubin has provided a free quiz to tell you which one of the four tendencies you are. In just a few minutes, you can be well on your way to benefiting from Rubin’s framework. <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4232520/gretchenrubinfourtendenciesquiz">Click here to take the quiz!</a></p>
<h1 id="here8217s-why-i-love-this-personality-framework">Here’s why I love this personality framework</h1>
<p>At first glance, it might seem like the BEST tendency is the Upholder and the WORST tendency is the Rebel.</p>
<p>However, while it might be easier in many circumstances for Upholders to change their habits, <strong>each of the four tendencies have their own strengths and weaknesses</strong>.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you’re an Obliger, you’re much better off playing to the strengths of that tendency than trying to move heaven and earth to change yourself into an Upholder!</p>
<p>Yes, be aware of your weaknesses. But play to your personality strengths!</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2017/07/want-to-change-an-important-habit/">Gretchen Rubin’s suggested habit-change strategies for each of the four tendencies</a>.</p>
