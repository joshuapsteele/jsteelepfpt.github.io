<p><em>[Ahem, in order to understand my first paragraph, you must first be familiar with the basics of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Speech Act Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you’ve never heard of it before, click that link, and then come back here. It will be worth it, I promise!]</em></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trinitarian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in nature and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ecclesiological<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in implication.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>(For an explanation of the Trinity, see my essay “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/">Trinity: What is it? (Why) Is it important?</a>“)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit’s illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible’s role<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of<!-- raw HTML omitted --> canon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ’s resurrection and ascension.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Tanakh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible’s narrative of YHWH’s redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Tanakh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as “the rule of truth”: the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible’s true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> according to the Scriptures<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial “point” of proclamation becomes a “line” throughout history by<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tradition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as “the act of passing down” and “the content of what is passed down.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->8<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This connection was so strong that he referred to the “traditioned” teachings of the apostles as<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in scripturis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, responding to those who accused these apostolic “Writings” of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles’ teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church’s recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->11<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Canon’s final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church’s recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Athanasius – the first canon list to include “all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->12<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism’s rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter’s present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As mentioned above, Scripture’s authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture’s authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jesus himself never shied away from claiming that he was the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 5:17; Lk. 24:25-27, 44). Indeed, he chastised the Jewish leaders for thoroughly studying the Scriptures, yet failing to see that the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Tanakh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bore witness to him (John 5:39-40)! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Likewise, in Acts, Peter (3:11-26), Stephen (7:1-53), and Paul (13:16-41) all portray Christ as the fulfillment of YHWH’s previous interactions with Israel in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tanakh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The written Word of God is authoritative in that it bears witness to the Living Word as the zenith of God’s redemptive revelation – the “image of the invisible God” in whom “the fulness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:15, 19, ESV).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When the Bible speaks of its own authority, it never does so apart from the life of the faithful, the Church. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The two favorite passages for the inspiration (and often, the inerrancy) of Scripture both refuse to reduce the Bible to a set of propositions to be debated within a correspondence theory of truth. The Scriptures were “breathed out by God,” not to be profitable for scientific analysis, but for “reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16, ESV). Furthermore, “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,” (2 Pet. 1:21, ESV) for the sake of the people of God, that they might know Christ (2 Pet. 1:12-21). Arguably, then, the ties between inspiration and sanctification are stronger than those between inspiration and certain common notions of inerrancy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At this intersection between the inspired illocutionary acts of Scripture and their perlocutionary effects lies the Spirit of God, who empowers the “inscripturate” Word to become “incardiate,” or “taken to heart” by God’s people.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->13<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pneumatologically, then, the Bible is able both to<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> become<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Word of God, as its written words are used in various ways by the Spirit throughout the ages to effect God’s mission of redemption <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->through<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his people.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->14<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The christological, ecclesiological, and pneumatological elements of the divine speech-act thus enable the written Word continually to be an indispensable part of divine discourse, instead of a merely static word.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->15<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Throughout the ages, God has used his Word – living and written – to do everything from creating the world, to redeeming it; from calling a people, to establishing orthodoxy and orthopraxy in his Church; from inspiring reformation, to drawing people from every tribe, tongue, and nation to himself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In order best to appropriate the written Word of God and submit to its continuing authority in their lives, the people of God should focus on proclaiming its central message as the Gospel of Jesus Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to accomplish fresh perlocutionary effects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through<!-- raw HTML omitted --> them as God’s redemptive mission moves toward its consummation – when the written Word of God will be in their hearts and the living Word of God in front of their faces, forever (Jer. 31:33-34; Rev. 21-22).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
