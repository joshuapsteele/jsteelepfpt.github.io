<p>What a relief, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!</p>
<p>But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that <em>prodigal</em>) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.</p>
<p>But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->changed<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> son. Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->proud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> threw it all away…<!-- raw HTML omitted -->for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ethan.</p>
<p>He received much more love than I ever did.</p>
<p>I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away!</p>
<p>I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch.</p>
<p>Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grilled pork chop remnants.</li>
<li>Crusty booze bottles.</li>
<li>Bacon pizza fragments.</li>
<li>Ashen cigarette butts.</li>
<li>The slimy shells of shellfish.</li>
</ul>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. “Jude! You’re back…”</p>
<p>And Jude <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->broke<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gentiles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>How can you continually scorn <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our<!-- raw HTML omitted --> father’s, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Father’s, <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->righteousness<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to <strong>run away with swine</strong>?!</p>
<p>Then, after the Father <strong><em>somehow</em></strong> took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – <strong><em>you bring the swine back into this house?!</em></strong></p>
<p>You think you’re so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>!</p>
<p>You think you know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->who the Father is<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what he’s like<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! We’re the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firstborn sons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of God!</p>
<p><strong><em>Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If you really loved God, you would <!-- raw HTML omitted -->follow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Law and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->keep<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the traditions…</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How can the Father love you? It’s embarrassing, really.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We never should have allowed you back into this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->house<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“Damn you, Jude! You Judaioi, you Jews!</em></strong></p>
<p>How can you continually forget <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our<!-- raw HTML omitted --> father, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Father’s <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->grace<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rituals<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, all your hard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lessons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> learned, were <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->a complete waste of time<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>!?</p>
<p>We Gentiles and God have moved on into the <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->age of grace<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>!</p>
<p>You Jews have FORGOTTEN the point of God’s grace, and so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He’s practically forgotten you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>We’re the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firstborn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->best-loved<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sons now.</p>
<p>We’re the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ones, and we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->outnumber<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you all at least three to one, so <strong>shut up and deal with it</strong>!</p>
<p>You’ve SCREWED UP so often, you got KICKED OUT of your land!</p>
<p>And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves THROWN OUT of Rome!</p>
<p><strong><em>How could Nero have let you back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong> looked at the other <strong>Gentile leaders.</strong></p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong> glanced at his wife, their children, and the other <strong>Jewish families.</strong></p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The <strong>slaves</strong> in the room – and there were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->many<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back.</p>
<p>Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said <strong>“Christ is Risen!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“…He is…risen…indeed,”</strong> they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle…</strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s in here, somewhere. Not this theology textbook. Not this to-do list…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ah! Here it is, a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After carefully opening the document, she began to read the following words.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, her first audience didn’t have the benefit of reading these words off a page, but that’s no excuse for you not to follow along in your Bible, if you’ve got it with you.</p>
<p>Open up to Romans 1, and as I read these words, imagine Phoebe reading them for the first time to a room full of Roman Christians.</p>
<p>Reading these words like she was convinced they were absolutely true.</p>
<p>She began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ our Lord,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called as saints:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>**First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God’s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. **</p>
<p>**For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you — that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine. **</p>
<p>**<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->**<strong>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.  I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.  So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, although that concludes the chunk of Romans we’ll consider today, Phoebe went on to read the rest of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7,114 Greek words<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the letter.</p>
<p>And, as far as we know, as the one to deliver this letter, she would have also been its first <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interpreter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That is, she would have answered the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->questions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the first audience regarding what had been read.</p>
<p>Now, despite Paul’s wide influence in the early Church, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that at least one woefully-uninformed Christian at Rome would have raised his hand and asked: <strong>“Who is Paul?”</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I mean, Who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Paul, really?</em></strong></p>
<h1 id="ii-from-paul">II. From Paul</h1>
<p>Well, as sister Phoebe mentioned, about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twenty-five years<!-- raw HTML omitted --> separated the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Resurrection<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of our Lord Jesus Christ and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul’s penning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the letter to the Christians at Rome in 57, 58 AD.</p>
<p>If you wanted to find <strong>Paul</strong> in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->same year<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Jesus of Nazareth walked out of his grave, you might be a bit frustrated as you repeatedly flip through the “P” section of your Palestinian Phonebook. Because, see, <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Saul<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>, of Tarsus, is your guy.</p>
<p>And, like some others whose names have changed, Paul had a <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->past<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p>He’d <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->done some things<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to spoil this with some alliterated list. I’ll let Paul tell you about his past:</p>
<p>In Acts 22:3-4, he says, if you’ll indulge the paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I’m a Jew. Sure, I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up right here in Jerusalem, educated in Dr. Gamaliel’s strict, strict seminary to learn and live the Law of Moses. I was just as zealous for God as any Jew. How zealous? I persecuted this Way, these Christians, to the death! I’d throw any of them I could, men or women, into prison!”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Acts 26:5b, 9-11, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I wasn’t just any zealous Jew, either. I was a Pharisee! […] I hated and opposed the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Jerusalem was my first Christian-hunting ground! I asked my superiors for permission, then threw those Christians in jail! And when it was time for their death-row judgment, I always cast a kill-vote. Just for fun, sometimes, I’d try to trip them up in synagogue – ask them just the right theological questions to get them to show their heretical cards. But deep down, I hated them. When they fled Jerusalem, I pursued them.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Galatians 1:13-14, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“<!-- raw HTML omitted -->You know what I did in my Jewish-only days, how I tried to wipe the church of God from the face of the earth. I was climbing the rungs of Judaism faster than anyone else my age. I was more zealous for the traditions than any of my old seminary buddies.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Philippians 3:5-6, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**“I was circumcised, I was as Hebrew as Hebrew could be; as to the law, a righteous Pharisee – no one followed it better!; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church;” **</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:13, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I once was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jew.</li>
<li>A Pharisee.</li>
<li>A blasphemer.</li>
<li>A persecutor.</li>
<li>An insolent opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Such was Saul of Tarsus.</em></strong></p>
<p>And YET, here, Paul, to the Christians at Rome, declares himself, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2 id="-_a-slave_">** <em>A SLAVE.</em>**</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, to his own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zeal for the traditions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the so-called “righteousness” of the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>But a SLAVE of CHRIST JESUS. Taking orders from the one whose name he had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previously<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->viciously<!-- raw HTML omitted --> endeavored to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oppose<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>Paul declares himself, second:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>NOT, as he had previously supposed, to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->persecute the Church<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plant churches<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! To serve the church as an APOSTLE, as an ambassador, as an envoy – with a message from his master, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>A slave. Called an apostle. Paul declares himself, third:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>NOT, as previously, for the sake of the Law as a Pharisee, which literally meant “one set apart.”</p>
<p>But set apart for the sake of the GOSPEL! The good news regarding his master!</p>
<p>Paul wants to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serve<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Church at Rome by <strong>preaching the gospel</strong> there, in order to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strengthen them spiritually<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the Romans will preach the gospel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in his stead<!-- raw HTML omitted --> until he can do so <strong>face to face.</strong></p>
<p>**No longer a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. **<strong>But now a slave, an apostle, set apart for the gospel…Such was Paul!</strong></p>
<p>**Quite the transition! Don’t you think?**</p>
<p>It almost make us wonder:</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But<!-- raw HTML omitted -->…c’mon, we’re not studying Paul himself. We’re taking a look at <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Romans<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, remember? And, while no one would have asked sister Phoebe this question back then, we need to ask it today:</p>
<p><strong><em><strong>Who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->were<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Romans? Who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->were<!-- raw HTML omitted --> these Christians at Rome?</strong></em></strong></p>
<h1 id="iii--to-the-roman-christians"><strong>III.    To the Roman Christians</strong></h1>
<p>Well, like everyone, name-change or not, they had a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->past<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>At <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> time – the Jews and the Gentiles alike – were both <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->faithless<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>. They were more or less <!-- raw HTML omitted -->groping<!-- raw HTML omitted --> along in the darkness until they came to know Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, we don’t know much<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how Christianity first spread westward from Jerusalem to the center of the Roman Empire. However, it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->probably<!-- raw HTML omitted --> taken there by Jewish Christians – perhaps by the Jewish “visitors from Rome” who, according to Acts 2:10, were present at Pentecost.</p>
<p>Regardless, those Christians present in Rome when Phoebe arrived were, in general, **no longer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->completely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> faithless. **After all, Jesus the Messiah had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enough<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a claim on their lives for them to risk attending <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a potentially unpopular meeting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And yet, much like Saul had been <strong>ashamed</strong> of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jews<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who had chosen to follow a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crucified Messiah<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (…not to mention how much that Pharisee would have been ashamed of Gentile sinners!)…</p>
<p>Now, not just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->annoyed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->irritated<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But ashamed. Embarrassed. Disgusted by the very existence of something, because it is humiliating.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Come on and feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this for a second. We know what it’s like, **to look in the mirror, to look back into our past, and feel gut-wrenching shame – at our high-handed sins, our careless words, our lies and our lusts. **<strong>Because we’ve DONE some things. We have a PAST.</strong></p>
<p><em>**Shameful, really.**</em></p>
<p>Well…Much like the previous Paul, the Christians at Rome were <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ashamed<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they were at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tempted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be ashamed of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Savior<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who didn’t exactly live up to the Roman ideals of <strong>power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>. This was real, this was raw. It may have been a bit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->embarrassing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sometimes, to walk by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->huge buildings<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->striking soldiers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Empire to go and worship in secret a guy who had been</p>
<ul>
<li>mocked,</li>
<li>beaten,</li>
<li>stripped naked,</li>
<li>and nailed to a tree</li>
<li>until he died like a common criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashamed, of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Second, they were ashamed of <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->each other<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</strong></p>
<p>I hope my, admittedly apocryphal introduction gave you at least a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->taste<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of what it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have been like to be a Christian at Rome. Based on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->historical evidence<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and what Paul has to say at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->end<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of this letter, we can surmise that the Roman church <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shifted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->predominantly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jewish<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to predominantly <strong>Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Positively<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this could have happened through <strong>new Gentile converts</strong>. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Negatively<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Emperor <strong>Claudius</strong> expelled the Jews from the city of Rome in <strong>AD 49</strong> due to a Jewish dispute about Christ. <strong>Acts 18:2</strong> mentions <strong>Priscilla</strong> and <strong>Aquila</strong> as two of the Jews thus exiled. With <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Jews forced to leave the city, the churches would have become <strong>predominantly Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p>However, after Claudius’ death in <strong>AD 54</strong>, the Jews began to return to Rome under the new emperor, <strong>Nero</strong>. …To return to churches now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->led by<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->populated with<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <strong>Gentiles</strong> – Gentiles who no longer followed certain restrictions in the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p><strong>Jewish</strong> Christians were ashamed of their libertine <strong>Gentile</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ. How could these people so quickly forget the Jewish origins of their faith?</p>
<p><strong>Gentile</strong> Christians were ashamed of their <strong>Jewish</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ, because they were <strong><em>personae non gratae</em></strong> – **unwelcome persons – to many Romans. **They only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->increased<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the risk that the next knock on the door would be an unhappy centurion.</p>
<p><strong>Ashamed</strong> and <strong>divided</strong>. Such were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Christians at Rome<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And yet Paul writes to them, to <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->call<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> them – as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had called them – to something <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->better<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>. What was it?</p>
<p>The <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“obedience of faith”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> – and here <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul’s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> transformation links up with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->theirs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Look at what he says in verse 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>through Christ <strong>“we have received grace and apostleship</strong> (Paul’s transformation) <strong>to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles</strong> (the Roman Christians’ transformation)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what does this <strong><em>obedience of faith</em></strong>, this <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->obedient faithfulness<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, if you will, <strong>look like</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest with you, Paul doesn’t have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to say about this in these introductory paragraphs. <strong>He’s starting his audience off on a long trajectory</strong>, but he does <strong>return</strong> to the obedience of faith at the end of this letter! The exact phrase appears in the letter’s last sentence, in fact.</p>
<p>But the idea of obedient faithfulness appears a bit earlier.</p>
<p>In <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->chapters 1-3,<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> we see what the <strong>opposite</strong> of obedient faithfulness looks like. At the end of chapter 3, we see what <strong>God’s saving faithfulness</strong> looks like (…It looks like Jesus!)</p>
<p>In <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->chapter 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, we see that obedient faithfulness still looked pretty similar in the Old Testament – with father <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Abraham<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>, of whom it’s said in verses 20-21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in faith as he gave glory to God, (even before he was circumcised, mind you), fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In chapters 5-8<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, we see various facets of God’s saving faithfulness as the foundation of our obedient faithfulness.</p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In chapters 9-11<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, we are reminded that there is HOPE for obedient faithfulness among the Jewish people, because God remains utterly faithful to his promises.</p>
<p>And, I suggest to you that Paul refers to this <strong><em>obedient faithfulness</em></strong> in the well-known beginning of chapter 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spiritual worship<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or your “<strong><em>rational service</em></strong>,” or your “<strong><em>obedient faithfulness</em></strong>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong>the rest of</strong> <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->chapter 12<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, we find out that obedient faithfulness looks like <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->humility<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> (12:3-8) and love (12:9-21).</p>
<p>In <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->chapter 13<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, we find out what <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->humility<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> and <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> look like when translated from another person to an impersonal government.</p>
<p>And then <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->in chapters 14 and 15<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> we get to the pastoral heart of Paul’s letter. The <strong>Christians at Rome were letting holy days and food laws come between them</strong>.</p>
<p>I find two verses of rebuke especially poignant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Romans 14:15 – <strong>“For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.”</strong></li>
<li>Romans 14:20 – <strong>“Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what I’m getting at: Paul calls the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ashamed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->divided<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Christians at Rome to the <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->obedient faithfulness of UNITY<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p>Consider 15:5-7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it: this is a far cry from Jude and Ethan’s passionate argument at the beginning! Again, we must ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</em></strong></p>
<p>The same thing that was powerful enough to change Saul to Paul: <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the gospel.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is the gospel?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong></p>
<h1 id="iv-through-the-gospel">IV. Through the Gospel</h1>
<p>Well, much like God’s people, including Paul and the Roman Christians, God’s gospel <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->has a past<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p>See, it was once a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->partial promise to the people of Israel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Writing to his divided and divisive audience of Jew and Gentile Christians, Paul begins with the gospel’s Jewish roots:</p>
<p>Look at verses 2-3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God had promised the gospel <strong>“beforehand through his prophets in the holy [Hebrew] Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jewish mission.</li>
<li>A Jewish hope.</li>
<li>A Son of David, in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->human flesh.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>But how is this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough to <strong>transform</strong>?</p>
<p>How does this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jewish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mission have a claim on the faithful obedience of the <strong>Gentiles</strong>?</p>
<p><strong><strong>Because the Son of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the Son of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->God<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</strong></strong></p>
<p>The one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->born<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crucified<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weakness<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of human flesh, is <strong>RAISED</strong> by the Holy Spirit in the <strong>power</strong> of <strong>resurrection</strong>! And this powerfully risen Messiah is the <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->LORD<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>. The <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lord<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> over more than Emperor Nero’s puny Roman playground. He is the Lord of heaven and earth! Of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>You know, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->merely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crucified<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Messiah is a <strong><em>poor</em></strong> Messiah indeed – worthy of <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->shame<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>. But a RISEN Messiah is a TRUE Messiah – worthy of <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->obedience<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong> and <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->faithfulness<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>.</p>
<p>Paul is therefore not ashamed of the gospel, because he recognizes its resurrection <strong>power</strong> – a power to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->save<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <strong>ALL</strong> those who believe – both Jews and Gentiles who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that <strong>Jesus Christ is who he says he is – the Son of God!</strong>,</p>
<p>Who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that <strong>he has done what he set out to do –</strong> <strong>to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->save<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->redeem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through his life, death, resurrection and ascension.</strong></p>
<p>The gospel is therefore powerful enough to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->save<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all those who <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that <strong>God is who he says he is</strong> – which is to say all those who <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->believe<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that God himself is <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->righteous<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p>He is <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->faithful to keep his promises<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> – his <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->covenants<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to Adam,</li>
<li>to Noah,</li>
<li>to Abraham,</li>
<li>to Moses,</li>
<li>to David,</li>
<li>to Jeremiah,</li>
<li>and to all of creation –</li>
</ul>
<p>his <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->promises<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to put the world back together again,</li>
<li>to not let Sin and Death have the final word,</li>
<li>but to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->raise<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his people from their graves,</li>
<li>to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->melt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> their hearts of stone,</li>
<li>to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->breathe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> breath, his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spirit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, into their dry bones and lifeless flesh,</li>
<li>to bring the dead back to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</li>
<li>to bring <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back to life, read Romans 8!</li>
<li>to make the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->faithless<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ones <strong>faithful</strong>, to make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <strong>faithful</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>God’s saving faithfulness to all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->through Jesus the Messiah <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->calls forth, by the Holy Spirit, obedient faithfulness <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->from all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->to<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Jesus the Messiah.</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>His <!-- raw HTML omitted -->saving<!-- raw HTML omitted --> faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obedient<!-- raw HTML omitted --> faithfulness, and his Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> it.</p>
<p>God’s saving faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> and the Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> obedient faithfulness:</p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So that<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, as Paul says in 5:21,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So that<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, as in 8:38,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“neither <!-- raw HTML omitted -->death<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->angels<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->heavenly rulers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor things that are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->present<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor things to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->come<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->height<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->depth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> else in creation will be able to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->separate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> us from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So that<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, as in 15:5-6,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“the God of endurance and comfort [may] give you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->together<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you may with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one voice<!-- raw HTML omitted --> glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>

<p>Now, I’m speaking to a room full of <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->seminarians<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>.</p>

<li>We <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->believe<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that the blood of Jesus is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->detergent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <strong>wash away our guilty stains.</strong></li>
<li>We <strong>feel an adrenaline rush</strong> when we read Romans 8:38,
<ul>
<li>because we <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that NOTHING will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->know<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that’s why Romans is so stinking long, why Paul couldn’t just start with chapter 14…</li>
<li>Because <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->we know<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that the only thing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough
<ul>
<li>to <strong>unite</strong> divided and ashamed Jews and Gentiles is the <strong>gospel</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->have faith<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> that the gospel is powerful enough
<ul>
<li>to transform Saul into Paul,</li>
<li>to unite Jews and Gentiles, to transcend their divisions!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*<strong>BUT: Do we have faith that the gospel is powerful enough</strong> <strong>to transcend OUR divisions?</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>…Is the gospel powerful enough to transcend our differences?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>…Is the gospel powerful enough:</em></strong></p>
<p>To unite liturgy-loving Anglicans with Bible-thumping Baptists?</p>
<p>To bring together, in LOVE:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contemporary and the traditional,</li>
<li>The “smells and bells” with the seeker-sensitive,</li>
<li>The 1928 Prayer Books with the 1979 Prayer Books,</li>
<li>with the “What’s a Prayer Book?”s</li>
<li>The Lutherans and the Reformed</li>

<p>…the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>“Do not destroy someone for whom Christ died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of _<strong>_</strong>_,</strong></p>
<p><strong>be it your prayer-book preferences or your theological idiosyncrasies.”</strong></p>
<p>See, Paul <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> have attempted to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unify<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Roman Christians by <strong>turning their faith in on itself</strong>. By encouraging them to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->admire<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as if in a mirror, the <strong><em>surprising fact that their diverse church existed in the center of a pagan empire!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But he did NOT do that! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong></p>
<p>Instead, he maintained that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gospel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reveals God’s righteousness <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“from faith to faith”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong> –</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong> the Faithful God <strong>TO</strong> his <em>previously</em> <strong>faithless</strong>, but <em>potentially</em> <strong>faithful</strong> and <strong>unified</strong>, people! <strong>FROM GOD TO US</strong></p>
<p>That <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->order<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> is important! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because it will not do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to engage in **_ecclesiastical navel-gazing! _**We can’t just look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ourselves<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and marvel at the fact that <strong><em>our diverse seminary exists in the center of a pagan empire!</em></strong></p>
<p>**<!-- raw HTML omitted -->No! We must look to Christ!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> **For he himself is our <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->peace<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, first with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->God<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and then with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>If we look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one another<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, before looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and try to transcend our differences <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on our own<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, then <strong><em>we will inevitably become <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ashamed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of one another</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Ashamed.</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t believe that God let some of y’all into his Church!</em></p>
<p>I’m embarrassed and frustrated by some of you. Sure, on my better days, I’ll admit you’re my brothers and sisters. But most days, we don’t feel much like siblings. Or maybe, we feel a bit TOO MUCH like human siblings, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bickering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nagging<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fighting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And sure, I know I embarrass and frustrate some of you. And if that doesn’t apply to you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->yet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, just <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->wait<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>! I’ll get there.</p>
<p>Friends, Sisters, Brothers, If we are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on our own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in this crazy thing called <strong>Church</strong>, it’s a hopeless, frustrating <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->mess<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>.</p>
<p>But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if we trust that Paul knew what he was doing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when he began with the <strong>GOSPEL</strong> in this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lengthy pastoral letter to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->divided<!-- raw HTML omitted --> church<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</p>
<p>If <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we look to Christ Jesus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <strong>trust</strong> that the gospel is <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> enough, not just to save, transform, and unify <strong><em>them</em></strong>, back <strong><em>then</em></strong>… but <strong>US, RIGHT NOW…</strong></p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we look to Christ and trust: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then,<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> TOGETHER we <strong>“may with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then,<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> TOGETHER we may <strong>“<!-- raw HTML omitted -->receive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> one another, just as Christ also received [us], to God’s glory.”</strong></p>
<p>Then, TOGETHER we may <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->believe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the words of the following hymn:</p>
<p>You’ve got a handout with the words. Would you stand and sing it with me?</p>
