      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Renunciations” (Verzichte)?</title>

      <description>In Discipleship (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus’ disciples living in renunciation (Verzicht) and want (Mangel).
Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are caused by Jesus’s call to discipleship.
Bonhoeffer also writes:
Although Bonhoeffer is willing to frame all of the Beatitudes in terms of want and (especially) renunciation, he takes issue with August Tholuck’s distinction between some of the Beatitudes speaking of want “and others of the disciples’ intentional renunciation or special virtues” (DBWE 4:101; cf.</description>

      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Good Works”? (Matt. 5:13–16)</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I wrote just a bit about interpretive approaches to the Beatitudes in Matthew 5. I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.
However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does not take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.</description>

      <description>As I said in my previous post, “Interpretive Approaches to the Sermon on the Mount,” I’m working on how Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.
Of course, when interpreting the Sermon on the Mount, the best place to start is at the beginning! This means beginning with the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:1–12.
The Beatitudes (Matt. 5:1–12) Here’s Luke’s version of the Beatitudes (Luke 6:20–26) So, what should we make of the Beatitudes?</description>

      <description>I’m working on how Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.
In order to help situate my discussion of Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s readings, I’m trying to get a better grasp of the various interpretive approaches to the Sermon on the Mount. So far, the most exhaustive Sermon on the Mount “interpretive taxonomy” that I’ve found has been from Grant Osborne’s Matthew (Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament; Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2010), 159.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.
INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH” On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”[1] He replaces Israel with the Church.</description>

      <description>I’m scheduled to give a paper on Karl Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 in Der Römerbrief at the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at Princeton in August.
Now, of course, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don’t know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth’s Römerbrief was a good idea!
Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21.</description>

      <description>(Here’s a PDF of this paper: STEELE_When Will Thy Kingdom Come.)
Introduction: “Thy Kingdom [Has/Will] Come”? Just how eschatological is the Lord’s Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), particularly in light of its second petition, “Your kingdom come” (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)?</description>

      <description>It just happened again. I had to consult “BDAG,” A Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed.).
I don’t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think “I really should buy this.” But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG’s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I’ve held off.
Nevertheless, I’m seeking to build my “must-have” personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian.</description>

      <description>Just came across this article in New Blackfriars, and it looks helpful, especially in the context of Anglican debates about women’s ordination.
Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”
Author: Geoffrey Turner
Abstract:
Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him.</description>

      <description>This is the question we’re considering this week in our doctoral seminar on biblical and theological integration. Two of us are theologians and the other four are bible scholars. Should be interesting!
(Note: we’ll have to save the difference(s) between systematic, historical, and dogmatic theology for another post!)
Here are the articles we were assigned to read for this week:

      <description>To start off the semester the other day, we prayed this prayer of confession together as a class. The professor didn’t remember where the prayer was from, so I tracked it down online. According to Justin Taylor, it was written by Bob Kauflin.
Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts.</description>

      <description>Personal Productivity in Psalm 127 I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).
Here’s how the Psalm opens:
Unless the Lord builds the house,
the builders labor in vain.
Unless the Lord watches over the city,
the guards stand watch in vain.
I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.</description>

      <description>The Problem: Studying the Bible can Quickly Feel Overwhelming Right? Even with helpful books out there like _How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth _(that’s an affiliate link, by the way, meaning that I get a small commission at no cost to you if you end up buying the book), there are still so many potential questions to ask of any biblical text when we study it.
How are we supposed to keep questions of authorship, genre, meaning, application, etc.</description>

      <title>The Hermeneutical Implications of Scripture’s Theological Location</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/hermeneutical-implications-scriptures-theological-location/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2017 15:22:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/hermeneutical-implications-scriptures-theological-location/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theological &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;hermeneutics&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what follows, I propose that &lt;strong&gt;we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological location regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first section, I will argue that the Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we clarify the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second section, therefore, I maintain that, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads: the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the third section, I offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. This has, I believe, implications for how the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture ought to relate to each other.  Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goodbyes-suck&#34;&gt;GOODBYES SUCK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were looking forward to a final dinner with me, in the school cafeteria, before they left. But I was worried about the awkwardness of saying a tearful goodbye between packed tables and chairs, so I suggested that they just leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say that my family wasn’t very happy. And me? Neither was I. I ate my first college meal all alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbyes suck. And I often suck at goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, this is my “goodbye” sermon here at St. Peter’s, and I wanted to give an excuse for this sermon, if it sucks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I do want to thank this congregation for being such a good place for Rachel and me to serve and grow alongside you. Thank you for loving Rachel and me as our brothers and sisters in Christ. We will miss you all very much as we move to Illinois this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I don’t want this goodbye to get TOO awkward, so I’d better keep on preaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that goodbyes are bad because they so often leave our stories unfinished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we humans tend to hate unfinished business. It’s so much better when the story has an end! Sometimes, even a bad ending is better than no ending at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it, if you’re watching an important game on TV – say, Alabama vs. Auburn – would you rather see the ending, even if your team loses, or have the power go out and completely miss the final minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories without endings are frustrating. And that’s why it’s so hard to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Death – the ultimate goodbye, if you will – is so horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not really an ending, not for those of us who go on living, anyways. Instead, Death leaves our stories hanging, with words left unsaid and promises left unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think here of parents in Manchester this week who were forced to say goodbye to their children all too soon, thanks to the suicide bombing. Or the Coptic Christians in Egypt forced to say goodbye to their loved ones too soon, thanks to the bus attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbyes suck, because they leave our stories unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: For other sermons, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/sermons/&#34;&gt;my Sermons page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-the-ascension-does-it-suck&#34;&gt;WHAT ABOUT THE ASCENSION? DOES IT SUCK?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Ascension of Jesus Christ, then, just another awful goodbye?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://henryhargreaves.com/no-seconds&#34;&gt;a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t know about you, but those pictures affect me deeply. The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus of Nazareth was no common criminal, his so-called “Last Supper” with his disciples was a poignant combination of the expected and the unexpected. And when you take a look at the Last Supper, focusing on its unexpected elements, you find out that it’s really a Lasting Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the Last Supper is not just a one-time event, some two-thousand years ago. Instead, Holy Communion, the Lasting Supper, is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-meal&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at the original meal itself, the “Last Supper,” as described in our Gospel lesson (Luke 22:14-20).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

[PDF Sermon Manuscript: Getting Ahead in God’s Upside-Down Kingdom]
Opening Prayer God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:
promote your justice embody your steadfast faithful love and humbly obey Your will, even if it costs us our reputations, and even if it costs us our lives.
I ask that this transformation would begin with me.</description>

      <title>A Disappointing Christmas Homily</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/a-christmas-homily/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! And Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, let us pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, they say that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. I’ve even heard it said that it’s the “hap-happiest season of all”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, can I take a poll real quick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please raise your hand if you’ve ever had a disappointing Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean a Christmas that didn’t live up to your expectations. You wanted it to be filled with love, happiness, and peace, and instead all you got was stress, anxiety, and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-you-ever-had-a-disappointing-christmas&#34;&gt;Have you ever had a disappointing Christmas?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Following Jesus Beyond the Bandwagon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A chapel message in a Christian school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you should know about me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a student at a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; high school, and a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; middle school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also: I’m &lt;strong&gt;the world’s worst sports fan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m like, “Game? What game? I don’t even know which sport’s season it is!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World’s. worst. sports fan. I’m telling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one redeeming quality about my sports fandom is that I’ve stuck with one team through thick and thin: the University of Michigan Wolverines. Go Blue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes is but a pale imitation of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn down here. But up North, this rivalry was and is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was really interesting, back when I was in middle school and high school, to observe what would happen each year in November when the Wolverines and the Buckeyes went at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m from Toledo, OH, which is on the border with Michigan, so the fan split was about 50/50 – Wolverines on one side, Buckeyes on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each year, on the day after the big game, you could tell who the true fans were…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the people still cheering for the team that &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;lost&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Readings: Psalm 34; Jeremiah 16:14-21; Mark 1:14-20
Like so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is a strong rebuke to our aspirations. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.
James &amp;amp; John: Fishermen No More? You see, James started off as a mere fisherman.</description>

      <description>What would it have been like, on the first Holy Saturday? What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?
All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.</description>

      <description>It’s been a grueling past few weeks at Beeson. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!
Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!
I have preached twice in the past month on Psalm 32. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C, for Dr.</description>

&lt;p&gt;What a relief, to get out of that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that &lt;em&gt;prodigal&lt;/em&gt;) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dad has &lt;em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;changed&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;only&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; son. Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;proud&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Ethan threw it all away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.” And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</description>

“If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.</description>

      <description>(PDF: The Hope of the Holy Innocents)
Today is December 28 (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “The Slaughter of the Innocents,” the killing of the baby boys of Bethlehem by King Herod.
The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back to at least the fifth century. In the fourth century, Chromatius described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf.</description>

      <description>Not to take away from the undeniably biblical teaching that God is almighty, but sometimes I think we lose sight of God&#39;s love for his image-bearers when we emphasize certain &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; portraits of God at the expense of (instead of alongside of) other &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; portraits found in Scripture. (I put &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)
It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&#39;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.</description>

      <description>Karl Barth&#39;s exegesis of Christ&#39;s wilderness temptations isperenniallyinspiring, but particularly poignant during this season of Lent.
What does it mean for Christ to be the Perfect Penitent? And how should this influence our own repentance?
The following series of quotations comes from a lengthy small-print section in CD IV/1, 259-73 (§ 59 The Obedience of the Son of God; 2. The Judge Judged in Our Place). There Barth walks through the three wilderness temptations before masterfully connecting them to Christ&#39;s experience in the Garden of Gethsemane.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I posted the beginning of Karl Barth&#39;s exegesis of Christ&#39;s wilderness temptations. He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&#39; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.
Christ&#39;s first temptation was to turn stones into bread, thereby using divine power as a &amp;ldquo;technical instrument&amp;rdquo; to save and maintain his own life.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reproducingKarl Barth&#39;smagnificent exegesis of Christ&#39;s wilderness temptations in Church Dogmatics IV/1.
It is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season ofLent, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction. Instead, he was tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For Barth, if Christ had capitulated to any of the temptations, he would have abandoned God&#39;s redemptive mission. Jesus Christ had to persist in penitence in order to be &amp;ldquo;the Judge Judged in Our Place&amp;rdquo; (Barth&#39;s most concise description of the atonement proper).</description>

      <description>Hey internet: I was recently given the chance to preach at my church, St. Peter’s Anglican, on the Second Sunday of Lent. The sermon audio is now online. If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, give it a listen! First, here are the passages: Psalm 121 Genesis 12:1-4 Romans 4:1-5, 13-17 John 3:1-17 Then, make sure to ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37 in the audio, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again.</description>

      <description>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it concerned the chaos at Cedarville University!
However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to my shameful alma mater at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the 2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS tomorrow (see my previous post, and come to my presentation at 5:00pm in room S009!</description>

      <description>Over the break between semesters at Beeson Divinity School, I’m reviewing Bruce Waltke’s The Dance Between God and Humanity: Reading the Bible Today as the People of God and Philip Goodwin’s _Translating the English Bible: From Relevance to Deconstruction _for Liverpool Hope University’s Theological Book Review.
I’ve just finished the latter, and hope to write my review in the next day or two. However, I’d like to share the following quotes on _Deconstructive Literalism _and The Perfect Translation, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to relevance theory, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition.</description>

      <title>The Epistle to Philemon: Analysis and Application</title>

      <description>As the briefest member of the Pauline corpus, the epistle to Philemon is a letter of recommendation for the sake of reconciliation in which the apostle Paul brings the gospel truth of mutual participation in the body of Christ to bear on an estranged relationship – making a delicate request of his friend Philemon to receive back a certain Onesimus into full fellowship as a brother in Christ.1 Comprehension of the passage’s contemporaneous Greco-Roman epistolary landscape facilitates a knowledgeable analysis of its constituent parts.</description>

      <title>The Holy Trinity: What Is It? (Why) Is It Important?</title>

      <description>Introduction: The Holy Trinity One God. Three persons. The Holy Trinity.
The orthodox paradox of this Christian confession confounds many, due to its apparent contradictions, abstractions, and absence from Scripture. From Arius to Augustine and beyond, trinitarian debates have raged even among those who agree that God exists, that the Bible is true, and that it is therefore worthwhile to consider what the Bible says because it reveals the existent God.</description>

      <description>(Here’s my paper on Psalm 2, submitted to Dr. M. Sydney Park in partial fulfillment of my Biblical Interpretation course here at Beeson Divinity School. Although I don’t consider this the best thing I’ve ever written, I’d love for you to check this piece out and let me know what you think, because no matter the limitations of the assignment, there’s always room for improvement. Plus, I didn’t have space to talk about all the issues whirring around in my head while writing this paper, and your constructive feedback might very well help me take my next intellectual steps.</description>

      <description>As the illocutionary act which testifies to the Son of God1 as the ultimate redemptive and revelatory locution of the the triune God, Scripture is used by the Spirit of God to accomplish the perlocutionary end of redemption of, in, and through the people of God.2 [Ahem, in order to understand my first paragraph, you must first be familiar with the basics of Speech Act Theory.

      <description>I highly encourage the following: Read Scot McKnight’s The King Jesus Gospel.
Check out Tim Gombis’ insightful series of posts on The Gospel of the Kingdom, pt. 1, 2, and 3.
Gombis hits the nail on the head here:
Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a question that has been on my mind throughout my final year at Cedarville University. After hearing of a few rumblings at the end of my Junior year, I left for the summer and got myself married. When my feet finally touched the ground at the beginning of term, my university felt like a battlefield. I heard that Michael Pahl had been “reviewed” and then fired over the summer months. Others were being reviewed to see if they really did toe the doctrinal line, or if they were guilty of mind crimes against the thought police. And things didn’t get any better from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the havoc that the Cedarville environment was wreaking on my mentors, friends, and their families. My leaders got rid of and harassed beloved members of my community, and then deceptively refused to own up to their nefarious actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/&#34;&gt;I got angry. I spoke up&lt;/a&gt;. And I was convinced that my anger was righteous. Others were less convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stayed poignantly and painfully silent throughout the chaos. Others repeatedly gave platitudes that everything was OK, that we were obligated to trust our leaders, that to question their actions was inherently disrespectful. And some from this latter group met my kind of anger with their own frustration and anger that I dared to criticize their beloved Cedarville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to say that I met this opposition with nothing but grace and equanimity, but that wouldn’t be true. I frequently lashed out against these types of people – when they sent me long messages to accuse me of causing unnecessary dissentious strife, or when they parodied us student activists as complete morons with nothing better to do than cook up conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Romans 13: Reading An Abused Text of Scripture Rightly</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/romans-13/</link>

      <description>Introduction This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.
Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.[&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.”[&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.[&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Introduction: Poverty and Wealth In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.
Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.</description>
