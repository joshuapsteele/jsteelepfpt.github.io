      <description>I received word yesterday that the Ph.D. Committee voted to approve my request for ‚ÄúExcused Program Leave‚Äù beginning in January 2021 and lasting until January 2022.
At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious, 2020 has been a particularly difficult year.
Attempting to complete my ‚ÄúBarth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible‚Äù dissertation has taken a toll on my mental health as I ran into some major research and writing roadblocks right before and during the COVID pandemic.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Just a brief update to note that I‚Äôm looking for a new role to supplement my part-time work as Managing Editor of Anglican Compass!

      <title>Josh&#43;? On the use of the sign of the cross (plus sign) in clergy signatures</title>

      <description>This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.
In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures‚Äîunless it‚Äôs done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient‚Äîis pretentious. It‚Äôs showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.
Note that I‚Äôm not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions.</description>

      <description>Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I‚Äôve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.
Sure, I‚Äôve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn‚Äôt having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and trapped often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.
I know, I know. That‚Äôs pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!</description>

I think I‚Äôll still keep my micro.blog up and running, but between running Anglican Compass and sprinting for some last-ditch clarity on my increasingly frustrating dissertation, I need all the extra bandwidth I can get!</description>

      <description>For months and months now, I‚Äôve been praying for either (1) a breakthrough on my ‚ÄúBarth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible‚Äù dissertation or (2) a clear sign that I should quit the Ph.D. Unfortunately, after countless confusing dead ends in my endeavors to put Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer into precise conversation with each other regarding specific passages of the Bible, I‚Äôve now realized that such an approach is not going to work.</description>

      <description>After realizing just how easy it was to lose access to the physical books that I own (now sequestered in my library carrel at Wheaton), on a bit of a whim I created a fundraiser to help my upgrade my Logos Bible Software library to either the Anglican Gold ($216) or Anglican Platinum ($582) libraries.
Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.</description>

Anyways, I just ordered the Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack from Amazon.
I still need a decent Olympic bar and Olympic plates.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong‚Äôs excellent book, Think Again: How to Reason and Argue.
In it (on pages 25‚Äì26), I came across ‚ÄúRapoport‚Äôs Rules.‚Äù
First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett (Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, 31‚Äì35), here they are:
1: You should attempt to re-express your target‚Äôs position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‚ÄúThanks, I wish I‚Äôd thought of putting it that way.</description>

      <description>I became an ‚Äúegalitarian‚Äù in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.
It‚Äôs taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women‚Äôs ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</description>

For my writing habit, I‚Äôve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks.</description>

Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it‚Äôs been a bear to get back on!
So, I‚Äôve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.</description>

      <description>This is a self-indulgently long story. The gist of it is that my wife, Rachel, was unexpectedly induced due to gestational hypertension at 37 weeks, right before we were supposed to head to Pennsylvania for her sister‚Äôs wedding.
After a lengthy induction and labor, our beautiful daughter, Eva Joy Steele, was born at 5:46am on Friday, July 20, 2018.

Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I‚Äôm sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be ‚Äúalone together,‚Äù looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).</description>

      <description>Getting Things Done (‚ÄúGTD‚Äù for short) is a wildly popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hear a lot of people talk about the¬†Getting Things Done productivity system anymore.‚Äù
I think that‚Äôs a shame, because it‚Äôs a very effective system.
I first tried Getting Things Done after reading ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Best Next‚Äù by Matt Perman, and then reading ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.</description>

I love all of The Oh Hellos‚Äô music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called ‚ÄúThe Truth is a Cave,‚Äù and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I‚Äôm calling ‚Äúthe theological journey‚Äù ‚Äì the stages one goes through in one‚Äôs knowledge of God.</description>

College gave me a love¬†for Christ‚Äôs gospel and Christ‚Äôs Church ‚Äì which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.</description>

It‚Äôs not the dying itself ‚Äì its the separation.
That is, we don‚Äôt suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.
A sad reality, to be sure.
What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage? I‚Äôm convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 ‚Äì</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm scared. Are you?
Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:
I‚Äôm scared ‚Äì I‚Äôm scared of wasting my life, I‚Äôm scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.
Fear drives so many aspects of our lives ‚Äì from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.</description>

      <title>Theology in Outline: What Do I Believe?</title>
      <link>http://example.org/theology-outline/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology is confusing enough, much more so when you attempt to summarize it all in a single essay! Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;theology-in-outline-an-attempted-summary-of-the-christian-faith&#34;&gt;Theology in Outline: A[n Attempted] Summary of the Christian Faith&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth ‚Äì the same person who had been crucified ‚Äì rose again from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can these things be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can the immortal, transcendent, omnipotent One come to a weak, immanent end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a dead human leave his grave, living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we face a crucial choice¬†between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the posited ‚ÄúGod‚Äù of metaphysical theism and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the revealed God of the Christian faith.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/03/29/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we choose the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt;, our Christ, canon, and confession are irreducibly &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;docetic&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ‚Äì the true ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is aloof, and merely play-acting, at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, should we choose the &lt;em&gt;latter&lt;/em&gt;, God is irreducibly, ineluctably Triune ‚Äì Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe, we &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; that the Triune God is who God has revealed Godself to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

‚ÄúIt is better to go to a funeral¬†than a feast.¬†For death is the destiny of every person,¬†and the living should take this to heart.¬†Sorrow is better than laughter,¬†because sober reflection is good for the heart.‚Äù (Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)

      <description>I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the 2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society has been accepted!
My theme lately has been to write on Karl Barth and the unity of the Church. At last year&#39;s Regional ETS (hosted by my seminary, Beeson Divinity School), I presented an edited version of my undergraduate thesis: Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God.</description>

      <description>For my 20th Century History &amp;amp; Doctrine course at Beeson Divinity School, I&#39;m re-reading through Karl Barth&#39;s Evangelical Theology: An Introduction. If you&#39;re involved in the life and ministry of the Church in any respect, I strongly recommend that you buy and read this book!
Here&#39;s a particularly challenging portion from the chapter on &amp;ldquo;Wonder,&amp;rdquo; beginning on page 71. I wish the language were gender-inclusive, but Karl&#39;s words still ring true:</description>

      <description>You‚Äôll notice that the previous post on Cedarville ends with a link to the Course Schedule:
‚ÄúClass Limited to Women‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I know, ludicrous. Especially considering Joy Fagan‚Äôs previous track record of making the first class, Scriptural Interpretation of Gender Issues (or SIGI), a truly excellent course by all accounts from former students, male and female.
Equally ludicrous? The textbook choices! Are you ready for what CU students will be reading to form an even-handed perspective of what the Bible has to say on gender?</description>

However, my schedule and blood pressure won‚Äôt allow me to devote any more time to my shameful alma mater at the moment. I‚Äôve got a presentation at the 2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS tomorrow (see my previous post, and come to my presentation at 5:00pm in room S009!</description>

Despite my Lenten Facebook fast, I was made aware of the following post by my friend Marlena Graves. I thought I‚Äôd share it, just in case anyone is considering Cedarville as a choice for college. I‚Äôd still strongly recommend you attend another institution, where you can trust the administration. My previous thoughts on these matters still stand.

The first: The Oxford University Press Award in Preseminary Bible, given to the graduating senior with the highest cumulative GPA in the preseminary major.
The second: The Daniel Award.

      <description>DISCLAIMER: there‚Äôs a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.
However, I‚Äôd like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.
Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I‚Äôd like first to aim them at myself.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you haven‚Äôt read my previous two¬†blog posts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light. (pt.¬†1)&#34;&gt;‚ÄúCedarville, Let there be Light.

(pt.¬†2)&#34;&gt;pt. 2)&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù please go do so before reading this post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: I‚Äôve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University‚Äôs recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University‚Äôs statement on Dr. Pahl, I‚Äôve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (&lt;em&gt;in the statement&lt;/em&gt;, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm writing today because the responses I‚Äôve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I‚Äôm doing something that is both &lt;em&gt;righteous&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I‚Äôm being &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-biblical and &lt;em&gt;disrespectful&lt;/em&gt; in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. &lt;a href=&#34;https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3AMatthew%2018%3A15-net_strongs__notes%3AMatthew%2018&#34;&gt;Matt 18:15-22&lt;/a&gt; and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, I‚Äôm a bit biased toward the first reaction. It‚Äôs always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn‚Äôt negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as &lt;strong&gt;boldness&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;respect&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;honesty&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;persistence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt;, a hunger for &lt;strong&gt;justice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an even &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt; craving for &lt;strong&gt;God‚Äôs perfect &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; peace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDr. Michael Pahl has been relieved of his teaching duties because he is unable to concur fully with each and every position of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx&#34;&gt;Cedarville University‚Äôs doctrinal statement&lt;/a&gt;.¬† This decision was made following a review by the University administration and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx&#34;&gt;trustees&lt;/a&gt; prompted by Dr. Pahl‚Äôs recent book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270&#34;&gt;The Beginning and the End:¬† Rereading Genesis‚Äôs Stories and Revelation‚Äôs Visions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pahl‚Äôs orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture‚Äôs inspiration, authority and infallibility.¬† He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.¬† Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sacrificing Scripture on the Altars of Our Own Agendas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôd like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization‚Äôs agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wedding Vows: My Personal Take on the Traditional Version</title>

      <description>The Traditional Wedding Vows In case you didn‚Äôt know, the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù wedding vows ‚Äì in English, at least ‚Äì are found in the Book of Common Prayer.
In the 1662¬†Book of Common Prayer, the marriage vows read as follows:
I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,
from this day forward, for better for wor≈øe, for richer for poorer, in ≈øickne≈øs and in health, to love and to cheri≈øh, till death us do part, according to God‚Äôs holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</description>

      <title>Unity?</title>

      <description>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.
What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I‚Äôve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.</description>

      <description>My Valedictorian Address, a Poem The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009.

Let me know what you think!
GRADUATION! Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word‚Ä¶</description>
