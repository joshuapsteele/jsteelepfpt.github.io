      This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.
In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures‚Äîunless it‚Äôs done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient‚Äîis pretentious. It‚Äôs showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.
Note that I‚Äôm not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions.

      This is a self-indulgently long story. The gist of it is that my wife, Rachel, was unexpectedly induced due to gestational hypertension at 37 weeks, right before we were supposed to head to Pennsylvania for her sister‚Äôs wedding.
After a lengthy induction and labor, our beautiful daughter, Eva Joy Steele, was born at 5:46am on Friday, July 20, 2018.

      Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.
Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I‚Äôm sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be ‚Äúalone together,‚Äù looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).

      Getting Things Done (‚ÄúGTD‚Äù for short) is a wildly popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hear a lot of people talk about the¬†Getting Things Done productivity system anymore.‚Äù
I think that‚Äôs a shame, because it‚Äôs a very effective system.
I first tried Getting Things Done after reading ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Best Next‚Äù by Matt Perman, and then reading ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.

That is, we don‚Äôt suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.
A sad reality, to be sure.

However, I‚Äôd like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.
Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I‚Äôd like first to aim them at myself.

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: I‚Äôve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University‚Äôs recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University‚Äôs statement on Dr. Pahl, I‚Äôve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (<em>in the statement</em>, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm writing today because the responses I‚Äôve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I‚Äôm doing something that is both <em>righteous</em> and <em>necessary</em>, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I‚Äôm being <em>un</em>-biblical and <em>disrespectful</em> in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3AMatthew%2018%3A15-net_strongs__notes%3AMatthew%2018">Matt 18:15-22</a> and such).</p>
<p>Clearly, I‚Äôm a bit biased toward the first reaction. It‚Äôs always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn‚Äôt negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as <strong>boldness</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>honesty</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>love</strong>, <strong>persistence</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>patience</strong>, a hunger for <strong>justice</strong> <em>and</em> an even <em>stronger</em> craving for <strong>God‚Äôs perfect <em>shalom</em> peace</strong>.</p>
