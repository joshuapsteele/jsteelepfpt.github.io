<p>So, in lieu of how effective <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/">putting money on the line via StickK</a> has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I’ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.</p>
<p>For my writing habit, I’ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I’m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)</p>
<p>For my Slow Carb Diet commitment, I’m going to keep the diet 6 days a week for 4 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 will go to NARAL Pro Choice America. (I’m pro-life. I think abortion is a tragedy.)</p>
<h2 id="try-stickk">Try StickK</h2>
<p>If there’s a habit that you’d like to develop or quit, I highly recommend giving <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/">StickK</a> a try! Fear of losing money to an organization you hate is a powerful motivator!</p>
<h2 id="try-the-slow-carb-diet">Try the Slow Carb Diet</h2>
<p>And if you’d like to lose fat/weight, I highly recommend the <a href="https://medium.com/@erinfrey/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92">Slow Carb Diet</a>.</p>
<p>It’s built around 5 simple rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule #1: Avoid “white” starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains. If you have to ask, don’t eat it.</p>
<p>Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You already do this; you’re just picking new default meals.</p>
<p>Rule #3: Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1-2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed.</p>
<p>Rule #4: Don’t eat fruit. (Fructose –&gt; glycerol phosphate –&gt; more bodyfat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are excepted.</p>
<p>Rule #5: Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/">pretty active sub-Reddit devoted to the Slow Carb Diet</a> if you’d like more information.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
