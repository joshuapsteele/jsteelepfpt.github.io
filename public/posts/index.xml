      <description>#ACNAtoo is a movement of survivors of ACNA-related abuse &amp;amp; their supporters seeking justice, repentance, healing &amp;amp; a healthier ACNA. This is an overview of the movement including what you can do to hear, to support, and to respond. By Whitney Evans Harrison and Conor Hanson.¬†Why we are here In May 2019, Cherin‚Äôs 9-year-old daughter confided in her that she had been repeatedly sexually abused by Mark Rivera, a lay catechist at Christ Our Light Anglican (COLA), the church they attended in Big Rock, Illinois.</description>

If there are two things I hate, they are waiting and staying awake. I hate waiting.
Ask anyone who knows me. I am absolutely horrible when it comes to delayed gratification. I‚Äôve been known to open new boxes of cereal on the way home from the store.

      <description>I received word yesterday that the Ph.D. Committee voted to approve my request for ‚ÄúExcused Program Leave‚Äù beginning in January 2021 and lasting until January 2022.
At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious, 2020 has been a particularly difficult year.
Attempting to complete my ‚ÄúBarth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible‚Äù dissertation has taken a toll on my mental health as I ran into some major research and writing roadblocks right before and during the COVID pandemic.</description>

      <title>Josh&#43;? On the use of the sign of the cross (plus sign) in clergy signatures</title>

      <description>This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.
In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures‚Äîunless it‚Äôs done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient‚Äîis pretentious. It‚Äôs showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.
Note that I‚Äôm not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions.</description>

      <description>Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I‚Äôve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.
Sure, I‚Äôve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn‚Äôt having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and trapped often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.
I know, I know. That‚Äôs pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!</description>

      <description>After listening to the Blinkist summary of Cal Newport‚Äôs Deep Work (I‚Äôve read the book, this was just for a refresher), I‚Äôm convinced that it‚Äôs time for another 30-day fast from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
I think I‚Äôll still keep my micro.blog up and running, but between running Anglican Compass and sprinting for some last-ditch clarity on my increasingly frustrating dissertation, I need all the extra bandwidth I can get!</description>

      <description>There is not unanimous agreement about women‚Äôs ordination in the worldwide Anglican Communion. Godly and thoughtful Christians hold opposing convictions about Holy Orders and who is called to ordained ministry. You often see the results of this debate at the Provincial level‚Äîa national expression of the Church may or may not ordain women, in accordance with their conviction. But for the Anglican Church in North America this disagreement is internal to the Province, varying from diocese to diocese and bishop to bishop.</description>

      <description>Almost every vocational deacon I know, when asked why he or she has not become a priest, will respond, ‚ÄúI have never felt called to the priesthood.‚Äù Some will add emphatically, ‚Äúnot for a minute!‚Äù
I am not one of those deacons.
I don‚Äôt share this story often, rarely in its fullness, and never in public non-anonymous writing. Be gentle with my soul, O Church. The words which follow are all too raw.</description>

the biblical and theological reasons for caring about social justice and systemic racism, the unfair ways in which some have used accusations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Cultural Marxism to sideline legitimate Christian concerns about social justice and systemic racism, and the legitimate Christian critiques of CRT and Marxism. Now, I know that there are plenty of resources out there that address each of the three items above!</description>

Christians believe that there is one God in three persons‚ÄîFather, Son, and Holy Spirit.
Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, ‚ÄúFather, Son, and Bird.‚Äù We‚Äôre working on that‚Ä¶
We Christians have been taught that the Trinity is important. No one wants to be a heretic.</description>

However, I‚Äôm worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I‚Äôd much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won‚Äôt!</description>

      <description>Certainly, the Bible has much to say about individual sin and redemption. But (1) focusing on ‚Äúsystemic‚Äù issues doesn‚Äôt need to negate a focus on ‚Äúindividual‚Äù issues. In fact, a focus on ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù actually exerts a lot of pressure to evaluate people individually, and not on the basis of their race‚Äîas long as we keep in mind how those supposedly individual evaluations are often subtly (and nefariously) shaped by systemic issues.</description>

(Note: This post is not a subtweet of anyone in particular. It‚Äôs just me thinking out loud about a phenomenon that keeps occurring.)
Almost every time we post something about women‚Äôs ordination, a controversial issue has been whether or not doing so needlessly ‚Äústirs the pot,‚Äù as in ‚Äúcauses trouble, unrest, dissent.</description>

      <description>Editor‚Äôs Note: The piece below represents the opinion of the author. Anglican Compass does not take a site-wide position for or against women‚Äôs ordination. We do, however, require both clarity and charity. We ask that your responses to it do so as well.
Over the past several months, readers of Anglican Compass have engaged with many opinions on the topic of women‚Äôs ordination. One wonders, given the state of dual integrities within the ACNA and the ever-churning blog debates between our public intellectuals, what is the point of another take on this issue?</description>

      <description>Writer‚Äôs block sucks. I‚Äôm currently facing it with regard to my dissertation and I‚Äôve decided to hit pause on research and writing until I regain access to my library carrell at Wheaton.
Thankfully, I‚Äôve come across some helpful advice on overcoming writer‚Äôs block in Andrew T. Le Peau‚Äôs Writer Better: A Lifelong Editor on Craft, Art, and Spirituality (affiliate link).
The book is filled with helpful and practical advice on writing, rewriting, publishing, etc.</description>

I‚Äôm hoping that this new arrangement works well for us! Although, to be honest, it‚Äôs still an open question in my mind whether or not managed WordPress hosting with WPEngine would be a better fit. I just can‚Äôt quite tell whether or not it would be worth the extra cost, given our current traffic and budget.</description>

      <description>What does ‚Äúreligion‚Äù mean? Great question! I‚Äôm writing my dissertation on Barth, Bonhoeffer, the Bible, and ‚Äúreligion.‚Äù However, getting clear on just what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is a huge challenge. It‚Äôs what I devoted my entire writing sample to examining, and I plan to devote an entire chapter of my dissertation to the topic.
Neither Barth nor Bonhoeffer used the word ‚Äúreligion‚Äù in the way that we‚Äôre prone to use the word in everyday speech today.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm trying to parse out the relevance of Barth‚Äôs and Bonhoeffer‚Äôs engagement with Scripture for making sense of the ‚ÄúBarth-Bonhoeffer relationship.‚Äù Specifically, I‚Äôm trying to, at the very least, add some biblical content and context to the ongoing debate over the relationship between Barth‚Äôs and Bonhoeffer‚Äôs theological critiques of religion.
As I put it in the ‚Äúelevator pitch‚Äù for my dissertation proposal:
In order to answer these questions (or at least move toward an answer), I‚Äôve spent a considerable amount of time looking for specific biblical passages that (1) both Barth and Bonhoeffer discussed (2) at least thematically in relation to their theological critiques of religion.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm still very much in the weeds, taking a closer look at how Bonhoeffer and Barth read the Sermon on the Mount.
Given the importance of the Sermon on Mount for Bonhoeffer‚Äôs life and work, I‚Äôm persuaded that there‚Äôs something important to be found here‚Äîsomething that will hopefully shed some light on the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship re:their theological critiques of religion.
Additionally, there are at least two other tidbits that have me interested in how Barth and Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.</description>

‚Äútheological triage,‚Äù ‚Äúdoctrinal taxonomy,‚Äù or ‚Äúdogmatic rank.‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to the process of distinguishing between various levels of importance when it comes to theological statements/positions.
So, for example, the Trinity would usually be considered a ‚Äúfirst-order‚Äù or ‚Äúprimary‚Äù doctrine‚Äîa ‚Äúdogma,‚Äù if you will. But a specific view of the end times would usually be considered a ‚Äúsecond-order,‚Äù ‚Äúsecondary,‚Äù or ‚Äútertiary‚Äù doctrine‚ÄîAKA ‚Äúadiaphora.</description>

      <description>In Discipleship (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus‚Äô disciples living in renunciation (Verzicht) and want (Mangel).
Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples‚Äô renunciation and want are caused by Jesus‚Äôs call to discipleship.
Bonhoeffer also writes:
Although Bonhoeffer is willing to frame all of the Beatitudes in terms of want and (especially) renunciation, he takes issue with August Tholuck‚Äôs distinction between some of the Beatitudes speaking of want ‚Äúand others of the disciples‚Äô intentional renunciation or special virtues‚Äù (DBWE 4:101; cf.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I wrote just a bit about interpretive approaches to the Beatitudes in Matthew 5. I‚Äôm trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I‚Äôm starting with the Beatitudes.
However, it‚Äôs pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the ‚Äústandard‚Äù approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does not take the standard ‚Äúentrance requirements‚Äù approach to the Beatitudes.</description>

      <description>In the ongoing debate about women‚Äôs ordination (in the Anglican realm and beyond), I keep hearing oversimplified claims from hierarchicalists (or ‚Äúcomplementarians,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not the most helpful term in this debate) that they have the entirety of the Bible and Church tradition on their side.
Therefore, we mutualists (or ‚Äúegalitarians,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not the most helpful term in this debate), it is argued, have arrived at our positions for various reasons‚Äîperhaps capitulation to liberal cultural trends and hermeneutical methods‚Äîbut not because we‚Äôve read Scripture or studied the history of the Church very carefully.</description>

      <description>When it comes to the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship, there is perhaps no greater conundrum than the meaning of what Bonhoeffer called Barth‚Äôs ‚ÄúOffenbarungspositivismus‚Äù (‚Äúpositivism of revelation‚Äù or ‚Äúrevelatory positivism‚Äù) in his Letters and Papers from Prison (DBWE 8).
Now, before we proceed, please note that Bonhoeffer meant something very particular by ‚Äúreligion‚Äù in his prison letters. For an overview of how Bonhoeffer and Barth differed on the meaning of ‚Äúreligion,‚Äù and what that means for how we interpret their theological critiques of religion, please see my essay: ‚ÄúTo Be or Not To Be Religious: A Clarification of Karl Barth‚Äôs and Dietrich Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Divergence and Convergence Regarding Religion.</description>

      <description>I really like the timelines of Bonhoeffer‚Äôs life that are available in The Cambridge Companion to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and in Bethge‚Äôs Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography. (Those last two links are Amazon affiliate links.)
However, I‚Äôm having a much harder time finding comparable timelines for the life of Karl Barth. The information is all there, but there‚Äôs no comparable table/list of dates in either The Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth or Busch‚Äôs Karl Barth: His Life from Letters and Autobiographical Texts.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm narrowing my focus to Genesis 1‚Äì3 and the Sermon on the Mount. Originally, my dissertation proposal cast a very wide net. I was going to have the following chapters:
Introduction (5,000 words) Chapter 1: Creation and Fall (Genesis 1‚Äì3) (16,000 words) Chapter 2: The Prophets (16,000 words) Chapter 3: The Gospels (16,000 words) Chapter 4: The Epistle to the Romans (16,000 words) Chapter 5: Completing the Biblical Critique of Religion (16,000 words) Summary and Conclusion (5,000 words) However, after doing survey work, and spending most of the previous academic year working on Barth and Bonhoeffer‚Äôs reading of Genesis 1‚Äì3, I‚Äôve decided to narrow my focus down to Genesis 1‚Äì3 and the Sermon on the Mount.</description>

I‚Äôm getting ordained to the priesthood tomorrow, and I‚Äôm both humbled and honored to serve Christ‚Äôs Church in this way.
Do I feel inherently worthy to be a presbyter? No.
Me, a 28-year-old, an elder?
But I do feel called.
I feel called to ‚Äúspend and be spent for the sake of the Gospel.‚Äù
I feel called to preach the Word of God and administer the Sacraments.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm trying to puzzle out the meaning of the following paragraph from Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Discipleship (DBWE 4).
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Discipleship, ed. Martin Kuske et al., trans. Barbara Green and Reinhard Krauss, vol. 4, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 82.
Here, Bonhoeffer appears to be contrasting the ‚Äúsimple obedience‚Äù required by a ‚Äúcostly grace‚Äù approach with a ‚Äúparadoxical obedience‚Äù required by a ‚Äúcheap grace‚Äù approach. The latter approach makes ‚Äúa general doctrine of grace,‚Äù and not ‚Äúthe living Christ himself,‚Äù the ‚Äúprinciple of scripture‚Äù (Schriftprinzip).</description>

      <description>The following is from Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Discipleship (usually known as ‚ÄúThe Cost of Discipleship‚Äù in English, although the original title in German was simply Nachfolge).
Bonhoeffer considers how we might respond to Jesus if Jesus were to show up and make the same kinds of concrete commands that he did in the Gospels.
NOTE: I‚Äôve taken two paragraphs in the original and broken them up into smaller chunks to facilitate reading here.</description>

      <description>This summer, I‚Äôve spent most of my reading/writing time working on a paper on Barth‚Äôs R√∂merbrief reading of Romans 10. This paper is for the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium, and it has taken way longer than I originally anticipated.
Will I get to use this paper in my dissertation? I‚Äôm not sure.
At first, I got excited, because, in my work on Genesis 1‚Äì3 last school year, I discovered some differences in how Barth and Bonhoeffer handled Genesis 1‚Äì3 vis-a-vis the subsequent history of Israel.</description>

INTRODUCTION: ‚ÄúGENTILES‚Äù = ‚ÄúWORLD‚Äù IS WORSE THAN ‚ÄúISRAEL‚Äù = ‚ÄúCHURCH‚Äù On at least one level, Karl Barth‚Äôs R√∂merbrief reading of Romans 9‚Äì11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù in Romans 9‚Äì11, Barth refers to the ‚ÄúChurch.‚Äù[1] He replaces Israel with the Church.</description>

Now, of course, it‚Äôs a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don‚Äôt know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth‚Äôs R√∂merbrief was a good idea!
Granted, I don‚Äôt have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30‚Äì10:21.</description>

      <description>I got my dissertation proposal approved in the Spring of 2018. Working title: ‚ÄúScriptural but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion.‚Äù
Barth + Bonhoeffer + Bible + Religion. ‚ÄúBarth, Bonhoeffer, and Bible‚Äù is the gap/niche. But that would be too much to tackle comprehensively in a dissertation. So ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is designed to be the delimiter‚Äîspecifically, Barth‚Äôs and Bonhoeffer‚Äôs theological critiques of religion.
Dissertation-wise, I didn‚Äôt make as much progress as I would‚Äôve liked to during the 2018‚Äì19 school year.</description>

      <description>(Here‚Äôs a PDF of this paper:¬†STEELE_The Tree of Religion Barth and Bonhoeffer on the Tree of Knowledge.)
Introduction The precise meaning of the ‚Äútree of the knowledge of good and evil‚Äù (=TK) has long vexed interpreters of Genesis 2:4‚Äì3:24.1 While the ‚Äútree of life‚Äù (=TL) is mentioned and alluded to throughout the Bible, the TK is explicitly mentioned by its full name just twice (Gen. 2:9, 17).[2] Nevertheless, because of the significant role that the TK plays in the narrative, both Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Karl Barth highlight the TK in their theological interpretations of Genesis 1‚Äì3.</description>

Introduction: ‚ÄúThy Kingdom [Has/Will] Come‚Äù? Just how eschatological is the Lord‚Äôs Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9‚Äì13; Luke 11:2‚Äì4), particularly in light of its second petition, ‚ÄúYour kingdom come‚Äù (·ºêŒªŒ∏Œ≠œÑœâ ·º° Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒ± œÉŒøœÖ, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God‚Äôs kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)?</description>

      <description>It just happened again. I had to consult ‚ÄúBDAG,‚Äù A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed.).
I don‚Äôt own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think ‚ÄúI really should buy this.‚Äù But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG‚Äôs cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I‚Äôve held off.
Nevertheless, I‚Äôm seeking to build my ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian.</description>

I‚Äôd like to share the three reflections/lessons Webster draws from the biblical work of Barth and Bonhoeffer.
Wrapping up his essay, Webster claims that
Neither Bonhoeffer nor Barth were wissenschaftlich theologians; both were practical or pastoral theologians of the church of Jesus Christ.</description>

Title: ‚ÄúThe Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‚ÄòPriesthood‚Äô Means‚Äù
Author: Geoffrey Turner
Abstract:
Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‚Äòpriesthood‚Äô univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him.</description>

      <description>I became an ‚Äúegalitarian‚Äù in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.
It‚Äôs taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women‚Äôs ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</description>

      <description>Maybe you, like me, are coming to Anglicanism from a different tradition.
If that‚Äôs the case, then one thing you should know is that Anglican debates about women‚Äôs ordination can often be quite different from debates about the same topic in other church contexts.
This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:
ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church), the sacraments, and ordination. For example, in my broadly evangelical/non-denominational/Baptist upbringing, debates about women in ministry centered on whether or not women were allowed to preach and teach.</description>

      <description>Came across this Barth quote in Church Dogmatics II/2 this morning. I really like it, because it‚Äôs a good reminder that Barth valued the Bible. His distinction between the Bible as witness to the Word of God and Jesus Christ as the Word of God did not cause him to abandon the Scriptural witness.
It is as well to remind ourselves, at the conclusion of this analysis, that the question: What ought we to do?</description>

      <description>There‚Äôs an intriguing passage in Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Letters and Papers from Prison where he discusses the relationship between ‚Äúspirit‚Äù and ‚Äúflesh,‚Äù in the context of discussing ‚Äúrestoration‚Äù and ‚Äúsublimation,‚Äù in the context of discussing lyrics from certain hymns and songs that were meaningful to him in prison.
Here it is, from a December 19, 1943 (the Fourth Sunday of Advent) letter to Eberhard Bethge:
In recent weeks this line has been running through my head over and over: ‚ÄúCalm your hearts, dear friends; / whatever plagues you, / whatever fails you, / I will restore it all.</description>

      <description>In The Epistle to the Romans, Barth writes the following concerning the false image of God at the heart of religion:
What men on this side resurrection name ‚ÄòGod‚Äô is most characteristically not God. Their ‚ÄòGod‚Äô does not redeem his creation, but allows free course to the unrighteousness of men; does not declare himself to be God, but is the complete affirmation of the course of the world and of men as it is.</description>

      <guid>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/karl-barths-reversal-on-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil/</guid>
      <description>I argue that, although Barth‚Äôs interpretation of the Genesis passages changed between The Epistle to the Romans and the Church Dogmatics, his mature readings of Genesis 2‚Äì3 still support his overall theological critique of religion as idolatry, the self-justifying positing of false gods.
Specifically, in Romans (240‚Äì57, esp. 246‚Äì51), Barth interpreted ‚Äúthe knowledge of good and evil‚Äù as the divine secret that humans are merely humans.
The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby concealed the creator/creature distinction and was meant to enable a direct relationship between God and humans.</description>

Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts.</description>

      <description>Based upon my own reading of Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Letters and Papers from Prison [DBWE 8], here is my attempt at a summary list of the facets/aspects of Bonhoeffer‚Äôs view of ‚Äúreligion‚Äù in prison.
Religion emphasizes inwardness. [DBWE 8:362, 364, 455‚Äì57] Religion emphasizes conscience. [DBWE 8:362] Religion is a temporary phenomenon. [DBWE 8:362, 364] Religion is manipulative and exploitative. [DBWE 8:363, 366, 426‚Äì27, 450, 455‚Äì57] Religion ignores human strength/knowledge/autonomy and instead focuses on human weakness, ignorance, and boundaries/limits/limitations.</description>

      <description>Previously, I wrote about how the Scripture search tool in the Digital Karl Barth Library was broken. Thankfully, it appears to have been fixed (although it still has issues). This means I can search Barth‚Äôs ‚ÄúCollected Edition‚Äù (Gesamtausgabe) if needed.
However, I‚Äôm now having some issues with the copy of Barth‚Äôs Church Dogmatics I purchased via Logos Bible Software.
Before I complain, let me first say how grateful I am that Logos is MUCH more user-friendly than the Digital Karl Barth Library.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôd like to pray this week‚Äôs collect again:
Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

I‚Äôm happy to report that, though the DKBL is still far from user-friendly, the Bible search works again!
Now we just need some angel investors and programmers to produce a user-friendly version of the Digital Karl Barth Library! üôÇ Any takers?</description>

Karl Barth‚Äôs Gesamtausgabe (Collected Edition) is finished. They are translated into a critical English edition. They are available within the same database/framework as Dietrich Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Works in English and German (DBWE and DBW). In the meantime, the Digital Karl Barth Library, provided by Alexander Street Press is the best resource out there for searching the text of Barth‚Äôs works.</description>

      <description>While reading Beth Felker Jones‚Äô Practicing Christian Doctrine: An Introduction to Thinking and Living Theologically, I came across the following list of extremely helpful questions to ask while reading theology (on page 29).
What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author‚Äôs driving concern or main theme? What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience‚Ä¶)? Is the author‚Äôs theological method implicit or explicit? How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?</description>

      <description>Kevin J. Vanhoozer, affectionately known by some as ‚ÄúKJV,‚Äù has written one of the best, briefest overviews of what theologians (should) do.
The entire piece is filled with gems like the following:
To become a theologian, you must be willing to bear true witness and call out false witnesses, casting down idols and ideologies. That‚Äôs the shadow side of theology, but the best part is speaking light and truth in astonished indications of God‚Äôs goodness.</description>

Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, ‚ÄúThe church is a cultural community.</description>

Scriptural, but Not Religious: Barth, Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion My project traces its origins to a single classroom discussion question in the Spring of 2015. The question was this: ‚ÄúIn what ways is Bonhoeffer‚Äôs understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Read my post, ‚ÄúTwo More Pieces about Jordan Peterson.‚Äù
If I remember correctly, I first heard of and listened to Jordan Peterson on an episode of The Art of Manliness podcast. (Or perhaps it was this episode.)
However, I could be mistaken, because Peterson‚Äôs been popping up in conversation all over the place in my circles. Blog posts, podcast episodes, conversations with friends ‚Äì Peterson has been popping up everywhere, so it seems.</description>

      <description>Tim Challies begins his book, Do More Better: A Practical Guide to Productivity with a bold claim: ‚ÄúI believe this book can improve your life.‚Äù
However, after reading the book, which is just 120 pages long including endnotes!, I believe that Challies makes good on his claim.
As far as explicitly Christian approaches to personal productivity go, Challies‚Äô Do More Better stands alongside Matt Perman‚Äôs What‚Äôs Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done.</description>

      <description>Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.
Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I‚Äôm sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be ‚Äúalone together,‚Äù looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).</description>

      <description>Getting Things Done (‚ÄúGTD‚Äù for short) is a wildly popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hear a lot of people talk about the¬†Getting Things Done productivity system anymore.‚Äù
I think that‚Äôs a shame, because it‚Äôs a very effective system.
I first tried Getting Things Done after reading ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Best Next‚Äù by Matt Perman, and then reading ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.</description>

I love all of The Oh Hellos‚Äô music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it.

The trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.</description>

But, I mean, come on. Who has enough time to read? I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôve got a stack of books a mile high that I‚Äôd like to work my way through.
Now, there‚Äôs a bunch of good advice out there about finding more time to read (see this post from Farnam Street and this post from The Art of Manliness).</description>

      <description>Why am I an Anglican Christian? Here are 3 reasons.
1. Anglicanism as a Refuge from Fundamentalism First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion! But, compared to some ‚Äúingrown enclaves‚Äù I‚Äôve experienced in my Christian upbringing, Anglicanism has been a breath of fresh air. It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to ‚Äúnot throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater.</description>

      <description>Personal Productivity in Psalm 127 I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).
Here‚Äôs how the Psalm opens:
Unless the¬†Lord¬†builds¬†the house,
the builders labor in vain.
Unless the¬†Lord¬†watches¬†over the city,
the guards stand watch in vain.
I don‚Äôt know about you, but it‚Äôs easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.</description>

      <title>The Hermeneutical Implications of Scripture‚Äôs Theological Location</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/hermeneutical-implications-scriptures-theological-location/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2017 15:22:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/hermeneutical-implications-scriptures-theological-location/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theological &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;hermeneutics&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ‚Äì human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God ‚Äì faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what follows, I propose that &lt;strong&gt;we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture‚Äôs theological location regarding its subject matter ‚Äì the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first section, I will argue that the Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture‚Äôs role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God‚Äôs people. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture‚Äôs subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God‚Äôs people, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we clarify the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second section, therefore, I maintain that, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads: the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; authors, texts, and readers ‚Äì especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the third section, I offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture‚Äôs subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. This has, I believe, implications for how the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture ought to relate to each other. ¬†Furthermore, because the Church‚Äôs understanding of and participation in Scripture‚Äôs subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to Dalio (ix),
Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be aplied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goodbyes-suck&#34;&gt;GOODBYES SUCK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if there‚Äôs one thing I hate, it‚Äôs goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I‚Äôm not really very good at goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were looking forward to a final dinner with me, in the school cafeteria, before they left. But I was worried about the awkwardness of saying a tearful goodbye between packed tables and chairs, so I suggested that they just leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs just say that my family wasn‚Äôt very happy. And me? Neither was I. I ate my first college meal all alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbyes suck. And I often suck at goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, this is my ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù sermon here at St. Peter‚Äôs, and I wanted to give an excuse for this sermon, if it sucks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I do want to thank this congregation for being such a good place for Rachel and me to serve and grow alongside you. Thank you for loving Rachel and me as our brothers and sisters in Christ. We will miss you all very much as we move to Illinois this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I don‚Äôt want this goodbye to get TOO awkward, so I‚Äôd better keep on preaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that goodbyes are bad because they so often leave our stories unfinished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we humans tend to hate unfinished business. It‚Äôs so much better when the story has an end! Sometimes, even a bad ending is better than no ending at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it, if you‚Äôre watching an important game on TV ‚Äì say, Alabama vs. Auburn ‚Äì would you rather see the ending, even if your team loses, or have the power go out and completely miss the final minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories without endings are frustrating. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why Death ‚Äì the ultimate goodbye, if you will ‚Äì is so horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not really an ending, not for those of us who go on living, anyways. Instead, Death leaves our stories hanging, with words left unsaid and promises left unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think here of parents in Manchester this week who were forced to say goodbye to their children all too soon, thanks to the suicide bombing. Or the Coptic Christians in Egypt forced to say goodbye to their loved ones too soon, thanks to the bus attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbyes suck, because they leave our stories unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-the-ascension-does-it-suck&#34;&gt;WHAT ABOUT THE ASCENSION? DOES IT SUCK?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Ascension of Jesus Christ, then, just another awful goodbye?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There is something special about last meals, isn‚Äôt there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one ‚Äì which I added, are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://henryhargreaves.com/no-seconds&#34;&gt;a piece called ‚ÄúNo Seconds,‚Äù and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I‚Äôll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don‚Äôt know about you, but those pictures affect me deeply. The whole idea of a criminal‚Äôs last meal affects me deeply. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you‚Äôve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life‚Äôs untimely end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus of Nazareth was no common criminal, his so-called ‚ÄúLast Supper‚Äù with his disciples was a poignant combination of the expected and the unexpected. And when you take a look at the Last Supper, focusing on its unexpected elements, you find out that it‚Äôs really a Lasting Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the Last Supper is not just a one-time event, some two-thousand years ago. Instead, Holy Communion, the Lasting Supper, is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-meal&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let‚Äôs look at the original meal itself, the ‚ÄúLast Supper,‚Äù as described in our Gospel lesson (Luke 22:14-20).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Opening Prayer God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:

      <title>To Be or Not To Be Religious: A Clarification of Karl Barth‚Äôs and Dietrich Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Divergence and Convergence Regarding Religion</title>

      <description>(Note: Read more about my work on Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible here.)
Christian theologians Karl Barth (1886-1968) and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) inherited a particular understanding of religion. In the broadly post-Kantian milieu, nineteenth-century thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, Albrecht Ritschl, and Adolf von Harnack defined religion essentially, anthropologically, and subjectively. That is, religion has a particular essence, and is in some manner inalienable from our humanity. The emphasis of this conception is on the experience of the religious subject, instead of the knowledge of religion‚Äôs object (let alone its reality).</description>

      <title>A Disappointing Christmas Homily</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 14:38:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/a-christmas-homily/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! And Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, let us pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, they say that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. I‚Äôve even heard it said that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúhap-happiest season of all‚Äù!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, can I take a poll real quick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please raise your hand if you‚Äôve ever had a disappointing Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean a Christmas that didn‚Äôt live up to your expectations. You wanted it to be filled with love, happiness, and peace, and instead all you got was stress, anxiety, and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-you-ever-had-a-disappointing-christmas&#34;&gt;Have you ever had a disappointing Christmas?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christians and Wealth: An Argument for Downward Mobility</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/christians-and-wealth-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2016 01:00:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/christians-and-wealth-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great news! If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here‚Äôs my argument in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;outline-of-my-argument&#34;&gt;Outline of My Argument&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our culture‚Äôs inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objections:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warrant:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God‚Äôs way of life in order to find satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For more on Christianity, wealth, and poverty, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2011/02/10/20110210proverbs-topical-study-poverty/&#34;&gt;my topical study on what the book of Proverbs has to teach us about poverty&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still interested in reading about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;this contentious topic&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;? Continue below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our current context of wealth and poverty existing side by side in a milieu of materialistic consumerism, the Christian gospel of denying ourselves and making much of God is being abandoned for the American gospel of denying others and making much of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Christians have become content to live a baptized version of the American dream, a hollow faith that is about maximizing your earthly portfolio once your salvation is secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main contention is that &lt;strong&gt;Christians in the United States should lower their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor&lt;/strong&gt;. In doing so, they will remain faithful to Scripture and discover a more satisfactory way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;isn8217t-that-asceticism&#34;&gt;Isn‚Äôt That Asceticism?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, some may claim that I am trying to advocate for a form of asceticism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A chapel message in a Christian school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you should know about me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a student at a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; high school, and a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; middle school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also: I‚Äôm &lt;strong&gt;the world‚Äôs worst sports fan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every¬†week, they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúJosh, did you see the game?!‚Äù ‚ÄúJosh, are you going to watch the game?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúGame? What game? I don‚Äôt even know which sport‚Äôs season it is!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World‚Äôs. worst. sports fan. I‚Äôm telling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one redeeming quality about my sports fandom is that I‚Äôve stuck with one team through thick and thin: the University of Michigan Wolverines. Go Blue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes is but a pale imitation of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn down here. But up North, this rivalry was and is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was really interesting, back when I was in middle school and high school, to observe what would happen each year in November when the Wolverines and the Buckeyes went at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm from Toledo, OH, which is on the border with Michigan, so the fan split was about 50/50 ‚Äì Wolverines on one side, Buckeyes on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each year, on the day after the big game, you could tell who the true fans were‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the people still cheering for the team that &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;lost&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This semester ‚Äî my final one at Beeson Divinity School ‚Äî I‚Äôm doing a directed study with Piotr Malysz on the topic of ‚ÄúReligion‚Äù in Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
The impetus for this study was a discussion question in Dr. Malysz‚Äôs Spring 2015 20th Century History and Doctrine course. On March 24, our third class period on Dietrich Bonhoeffer, our second question for discussion read as follows:</description>

Like so many other feast days ‚Äì scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes‚Äô deaths ‚Äì the feast day of St. James the Apostle is a strong rebuke to our aspirations. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ‚Äôs Church.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I asked you &lt;a href=&#34;http://frustrated&#34;&gt;to join the Church if you, like me, are frustrated with the Church&lt;/a&gt;. The strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community. Plus, your frustrations are likely shared by many others within the Church!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it‚Äôs not enough to point the finger at others from your pew, instead of doing so from the public square. Yes, that‚Äôs a good first step, but another one is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>‚Ä¶and by ‚Äúclub‚Äù I of course mean ‚ÄúChurch‚Äù!
What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere ‚Äúclub‚Äù?
No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn‚Äôt it?
A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes. A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping. A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners. Perhaps you‚Äôre sick of this ‚Äúclub,‚Äù and you‚Äôre ready to leave, if you haven‚Äôt left already.</description>

      <description>As I prepare for my final semester at Beeson Divinity School, it strikes me just how well I was prepared for my seminary education by my undergraduate professors at Cedarville University.
All things considered, my time at CU exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more.
College gave me a love¬†for Christ‚Äôs gospel and Christ‚Äôs Church ‚Äì which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.</description>

      <description>Do you know what the worst thing about death is?
It‚Äôs not the dying itself ‚Äì its the separation.
That is, we don‚Äôt suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.
A sad reality, to be sure.
What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage? I‚Äôm convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 ‚Äì</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm not going to lie. My first reaction when I saw the cover of this book?¬†No! Of course you‚Äôre not indispensable. What use could this crap possibly be to the Church, or to me ‚Äì simultaneously a pastor and a pastor-in-training. Then, however, I read the book. And I suggest you do, too!

      <description>I‚Äôm scared. Are you?
Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:
I‚Äôm scared ‚Äì I‚Äôm scared of wasting my life, I‚Äôm scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.
Fear drives so many aspects of our lives ‚Äì from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.</description>

      <description>I love books. Books, however, do not like my back.
Can you relate?
Maybe it‚Äôs not sitting around reading books all day, but I imagine plenty of you out there suffer from back pain/fatigue.
Let me share a time-saving solution I‚Äôve recently found: two-handed kettlebell swings.
How can these cannonballs with handles help your back?
Well, the kettlebell swing is one of the many exercises out there that activates your posterior chain ‚Äì the muscles along the back of your body.</description>

      <description>Hi internet ‚Äì especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.
I‚Äôm in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.
Here‚Äôs my goal: to explore the possible relationship between Barth‚Äôs critique of the ‚ÄúNo-God‚Äù(Nich-Gott) and Bonhoeffer‚Äôs critique(s) of viewing God as a ‚Äústopgap‚Äù (L√ºckenb√º√üer) or ‚Äúworking hypothesis.‚Äù
As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the Romans commentary, Garrett Green‚Äôs recent re-translation of¬†CD ¬ß17, and¬†Letters and Papers from Prison.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs been a grueling past few weeks at Beeson. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can‚Äôt come quickly enough!
Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God‚Äôs Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!
I have preached twice in the past month on Psalm 32. First, I delivered a sermon (‚ÄúThe Refreshment of Forgiveness‚Äù) designed for the Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C, for Dr.</description>

      <title>Improvising Church &amp; State: Overaccepting as a Synthesis of Anglican and Anabaptist Approaches</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/improvising-church-state/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-accepting-blocking-and-status&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION: ACCEPTING, BLOCKING, AND STATUS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the church‚Äôs perspective, is the state a promising offer, or a threatening one? At the risk of breathtaking oversimplification, Anglicans have tended to adopt the former perspective, leading to accommodation, and Anabaptists the latter, resulting in separation.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Following Samuel Wells in his theological appropriation of terms from theatrical improvisation, the Anglican tradition has tended to respond to the promising &lt;em&gt;offers&lt;/em&gt; (invitations to respond) of the state by &lt;em&gt;accepting&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äì maintaining the premise(s) of the state‚Äôs action(s).&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[2]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; The historical legacy of the Church of England has given Anglicanism, as Anderson notes, an ‚Äúinheritance of a strong loyalty to the state and a conservatism that has led the church to promote the status quo more often than it agitates for reform.‚Äù&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[3]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; This inheritance from the established Church of England has coincided with a dual tendency to adopt a high &lt;em&gt;status&lt;/em&gt; (a strategy for getting one‚Äôs way), in terms of relative privilege and political optimism, and a low status, in terms of frequent subservience in church-state relations.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[4]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: ‚Äú&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/&#34;&gt;Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Anabaptist tradition has tended to respond to the threatening offers of the state by &lt;em&gt;blocking&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äì undermining the premise(s) of the state‚Äôs action(s).&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[5]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; For many contemporary Anabaptists, as Joireman summarizes, ‚Äú[T]he state has the function of ordering the social world, and the church should be the visible witness of believers, the primary affiliation of Christians, and separate from the state.‚Äù&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[6]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Passively, blocking the state can be ‚Äúa choice to shut oneself away and keep oneself unsullied by the world.‚Äù&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[7]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Most often, drawing upon their sixteenth-century inheritance of facing persecution from Catholics and Protestants alike, Anabaptists have adopted a low status as somewhat of a fringe movement. Actively, however, blocking can be ‚Äúa choice to take up arms,‚Äù as seen during the (admittedly rare) example of high status Anabaptist opposition during the M√ºnster Rebellion of 1534.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;[8]&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology is confusing enough, much more so when you attempt to summarize it all in a single essay! Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;theology-in-outline-an-attempted-summary-of-the-christian-faith&#34;&gt;Theology in Outline: A[n Attempted] Summary of the Christian Faith&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth ‚Äì the same person who had been crucified ‚Äì rose again from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can these things be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can the immortal, transcendent, omnipotent One come to a weak, immanent end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a dead human leave his grave, living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we face a crucial choice¬†between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the posited ‚ÄúGod‚Äù of metaphysical theism and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the revealed God of the Christian faith.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/03/29/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we choose the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt;, our Christ, canon, and confession are irreducibly &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;docetic&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ‚Äì the true ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is aloof, and merely play-acting, at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, should we choose the &lt;em&gt;latter&lt;/em&gt;, God is irreducibly, ineluctably Triune ‚Äì Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe, we &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; that the Triune God is who God has revealed Godself to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What a relief, to get out of that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father‚Äôs request to purchase farming equipment from the next city ‚Äì a three-day journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that &lt;em&gt;prodigal&lt;/em&gt;) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man‚Äôs presence for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDad has &lt;em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;changed&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.¬†Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;only&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; son.¬†Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;proud&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Ethan threw it all away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, ‚ÄúWhy does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.‚Äù And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</description>

‚ÄúIf you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.For he who said, ‚ÄúDo not commit adultery,‚Äù also said, ‚ÄúDo not murder.</description>

      <description>What Does It Mean to Be Human? A clue to the answer lies in the asking of the question, for this act presupposes both a [human] subject and object in a dialectic of self-transcendence.
As Robert Jenson notes, ‚Äúin asking this question, we somehow take up a vantage outside ourselves to make ourselves our own objects, get beyond ourselves to look back at ourselves.‚Äù1 The mystery of human existence is ‚Äúthat I am the subject of the object I am and the object of the subject I am.</description>

Joshua P. Steele
INTRODUCTION Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth‚Äôs theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church1 and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. Two excerpts from the Barthian corpus legitimize this connection.</description>

      <description>(PDF: The Hope of the Holy Innocents)
Today is December 28¬†(2014) ‚Äì just the third day since Christmas ‚Äì a commemoration of what is often called ‚ÄúThe Slaughter of the Innocents,‚Äù the killing of the baby boys of Bethlehem by King Herod.
The Church‚Äôs regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back to at least the fifth century. In the fourth century, Chromatius described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ ‚Äì the first counted worthy to die on Christ‚Äôs behalf.</description>

      <description>Not to take away from the undeniably biblical teaching that God is almighty, but sometimes I think we lose sight of God&#39;s love for his image-bearers when we emphasize certain &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; portraits of God at the expense of (instead of alongside of) other &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; portraits found in Scripture. (I put &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)
It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&#39;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.</description>

‚ÄúIt is better to go to a funeral¬†than a feast.¬†For death is the destiny of every person,¬†and the living should take this to heart.¬†Sorrow is better than laughter,¬†because sober reflection is good for the heart.‚Äù (Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)

      <description>I&#39;m not the most thankful person.
However, I am a follower of Jesus, and one of the lessons I&#39;ve been learning this semester is that praise, thanksgiving, and gratitude are closely intertwined. Worship should involve the public proclamation of who God is and what He has done ‚Äî including specific, personal declarations of thanksgiving for God&#39;s grace and good gifts.
If, like me, you have a hard time cultivating this worshipful practice of gratitude, then allow me to suggest the following prayers from the Book of Common Prayer to help get us started.</description>

      <description>Karl Barth&#39;s exegesis of Christ&#39;s wilderness temptations isperenniallyinspiring, but particularly poignant during this season of Lent.
What does it mean for Christ to be the Perfect Penitent? And how should this influence our own repentance?
The following series of quotations comes from a lengthy small-print section in CD IV/1, 259-73 (¬ß 59 The Obedience of the Son of God; 2. The Judge Judged in Our Place). There Barth walks through the three wilderness temptations before masterfully connecting them to Christ&#39;s experience in the Garden of Gethsemane.</description>

My theme lately has been to write on Karl Barth and the unity of the Church.

      <description>Yesterday I posted the beginning of Karl Barth&#39;s exegesis of Christ&#39;s wilderness temptations. He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&#39; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.
Christ&#39;s first temptation was to turn stones into bread, thereby using divine power as a &amp;ldquo;technical instrument&amp;rdquo; to save and maintain his own life.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reproducingKarl Barth&#39;smagnificent exegesis of Christ&#39;s wilderness temptations in Church Dogmatics IV/1.
It is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season ofLent, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction. Instead, he was tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For Barth, if Christ had capitulated to any of the temptations, he would have abandoned God&#39;s redemptive mission. Jesus Christ had to persist in penitence in order to be &amp;ldquo;the Judge Judged in Our Place&amp;rdquo; (Barth&#39;s most concise description of the atonement proper).</description>

Here&#39;s a particularly challenging portion from the chapter on &amp;ldquo;Wonder,&amp;rdquo; beginning on page 71. I wish the language were gender-inclusive, but Karl&#39;s words still ring true:</description>

      <description>The following essay deals with the theme of the fear of death in¬†White Noise, the novel by Don DeLillo (affiliate link).
Don DeLillo‚Äôs White Noise, ‚Äúa paradigm of postmodern literature,‚Äù2 yields the kind of cognitive dissonance that makes you wonder whether the author simply missed the mark, or if you are only confused because you suffer from the postmodern condition which DeLillo adroitly analyzes.
I agree with Pico Iyer when he evaluates DeLillo as ‚Äúthat rarest of birds, a novelist on fire with ideas ‚Äì and an outlaw epistemologist to boot ‚Äì he uses his fictional excursions as occasions to think aloud in shadowed sentences, speak in modern tongues, plumb mysteries, fathom depths.</description>

If you‚Äôve got 23 minutes to spare, give it a listen!¬†First, here are the passages:¬†Psalm 121 Genesis 12:1-4 Romans 4:1-5, 13-17 John 3:1-17 Then, make sure to ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37 in the audio, I departed from my notes ‚Äî which ended at ‚ÄúNicodemus then fades from the narrative,‚Äù (which he does in the passage at hand) ‚Äî and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again.</description>

‚ÄúClass Limited to Women‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I know, ludicrous. Especially considering Joy Fagan‚Äôs previous track record of making the first class, Scriptural Interpretation of Gender Issues (or SIGI), a truly excellent course by all accounts from former students, male and female.
Equally ludicrous? The textbook choices! Are you ready for what CU students will be reading to form an even-handed perspective of what the Bible has to say on gender?</description>

      <description>As the briefest member of the Pauline corpus, the epistle to Philemon is a letter of recommendation for the sake of reconciliation in which the apostle Paul brings the gospel truth of mutual participation in the body of Christ to bear on an estranged relationship ‚Äì making a delicate request of his friend Philemon to receive back a certain Onesimus into full fellowship as a brother in Christ.1 Comprehension of the passage‚Äôs contemporaneous Greco-Roman epistolary landscape facilitates a knowledgeable analysis of its constituent parts.</description>

The orthodox paradox of this Christian confession confounds many, due to its apparent contradictions, abstractions, and absence from Scripture. From Arius to Augustine and beyond, trinitarian debates have raged even among those who agree that God exists, that the Bible is true, and that it is therefore worthwhile to consider what the Bible says because it reveals the existent God.</description>

      <description>As the illocutionary act which testifies to the Son of God1 as the ultimate redemptive and revelatory locution of the the triune God, Scripture is used by the Spirit of God to accomplish the perlocutionary end of redemption of, in, and through the people of God.2 [Ahem, in order to understand my first paragraph, you must first be familiar with the basics of Speech Act Theory.

      <description>I highly encourage the following:¬†Read Scot McKnight‚Äôs The King Jesus Gospel.
Check out Tim Gombis‚Äô insightful series of posts on The Gospel of the Kingdom, pt. 1, 2, and 3.
Gombis hits the nail on the head here:
Over the last several months, I‚Äôve had several conversations about how the Gospels‚Äô language about ‚Äúthe gospel‚Äù should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel.¬†Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate ‚Äúthe gospel‚Äù with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a question that has been on my mind throughout my final year at Cedarville University. After hearing of a few rumblings at the end of my Junior year, I left for the summer and got myself married. When my feet finally touched the ground at the beginning of term, my university felt like a battlefield. I heard that Michael Pahl had been ‚Äúreviewed‚Äù and then fired over the summer months. Others were being reviewed to see if they really did toe the doctrinal line, or if they were guilty of mind crimes against the thought police. And things didn‚Äôt get any better from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the havoc that the Cedarville environment was wreaking on my mentors, friends, and their families. My leaders got rid of and harassed beloved members of my community, and then deceptively refused to own up to their nefarious actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/&#34;&gt;I got angry. I spoke up&lt;/a&gt;. And I was convinced that my anger was righteous. Others were less convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stayed poignantly and painfully silent throughout the chaos. Others repeatedly gave platitudes that everything was OK, that we were obligated to trust our leaders, that to question their actions was inherently disrespectful. And some from this latter group met my kind of anger with their own frustration and anger that I dared to criticize their beloved Cedarville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd love to say that I met this opposition with nothing but grace and equanimity, but that wouldn‚Äôt be true. I frequently lashed out against these types of people ‚Äì when they sent me long messages to accuse me of causing unnecessary dissentious strife, or when they parodied us student activists as complete morons with nothing better to do than cook up conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I received two awards at Cedarville University‚Äôs 49th Annual Academic Honors Day Chapel.
The first: The Oxford University Press Award in Preseminary Bible, given to the graduating senior with the highest cumulative GPA in the preseminary major.
The second: The Daniel Award.
The first award got me a copy of The Contemporary Parallel New Testament (edited by Kohlenberger, III). The second award?</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: there‚Äôs a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.
However, I‚Äôd like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.
Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I‚Äôd like first to aim them at myself.</description>

After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.</description>

      <title>Romans 13: Reading An Abused Text of Scripture Rightly</title>
      <link>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/romans-13/</link>

      <guid>https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/romans-13/</guid>
      <description>Introduction This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.
Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you haven‚Äôt read my previous two¬†blog posts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light.

(pt. 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-2/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light. (pt.¬†2)&#34;&gt;pt. 2)&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù please go do so before reading this post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: I‚Äôve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University‚Äôs recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University‚Äôs statement on Dr. Pahl, I‚Äôve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (&lt;em&gt;in the statement&lt;/em&gt;, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm writing today because the responses I‚Äôve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I‚Äôm doing something that is both &lt;em&gt;righteous&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I‚Äôm being &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-biblical and &lt;em&gt;disrespectful&lt;/em&gt; in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. &lt;a href=&#34;https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3AMatthew%2018%3A15-net_strongs__notes%3AMatthew%2018&#34;&gt;Matt 18:15-22&lt;/a&gt; and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, I‚Äôm a bit biased toward the first reaction. It‚Äôs always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn‚Äôt negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as &lt;strong&gt;boldness&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;respect&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;honesty&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;persistence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt;, a hunger for &lt;strong&gt;justice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an even &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt; craving for &lt;strong&gt;God‚Äôs perfect &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; peace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-statement&#34;&gt;The Statement:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDr. Michael Pahl has been relieved of his teaching duties because he is unable to concur fully with each and every position of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx&#34;&gt;Cedarville University‚Äôs doctrinal statement&lt;/a&gt;.¬† This decision was made following a review by the University administration and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx&#34;&gt;trustees&lt;/a&gt; prompted by Dr. Pahl‚Äôs recent book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270&#34;&gt;The Beginning and the End:¬† Rereading Genesis‚Äôs Stories and Revelation‚Äôs Visions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pahl‚Äôs orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture‚Äôs inspiration, authority and infallibility.¬† He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.¬† Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sacrificing Scripture on the Altars of Our Own Agendas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôd like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization‚Äôs agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God‚Äôs creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God‚Äôs temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.[&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: ‚ÄúInstead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.‚Äù[&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture‚Äôs use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.[&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsteelepfpt.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wedding Vows: My Personal Take on the Traditional Version</title>

      <description>The Traditional Wedding Vows In case you didn‚Äôt know, the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù wedding vows ‚Äì in English, at least ‚Äì are found in the Book of Common Prayer.
In the 1662¬†Book of Common Prayer, the marriage vows read as follows:
I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,
from this day forward, for better for wor≈øe, for richer for poorer, in ≈øickne≈øs and in health, to love and to cheri≈øh, till death us do part, according to God‚Äôs holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</description>

      <description>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.
What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I‚Äôve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.</description>

      <description>After reading The King Jesus Gospel: The Original Good News Revisited by Scot McKnight, who makes the claim that the gospel is the saving story of Jesus as Messiah, King, and Lord as the completion to the story of Israel, I started to notice some profound gospel messages in the Christmas carols we often sing during this season.
I have found that several of these carols go much deeper (much more biblical) than the personal salvation ‚Äúgospel‚Äù of sin-management that we often preach and sing about.</description>

I just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: ‚ÄúThinking Theologically About Memorial Day‚Äù. Listen to his intro:
This post probably has something to make everyone unhappy. But here goes.
With Memorial Day on Monday (in the U.S.) and, no doubt, a number of patriotic services scheduled for this Sunday, I want to offer a few theses on patriotism and the church.</description>

      <title>What the Bible Says About Poverty: The Book of Proverbs</title>

      <description>Introduction: Poverty and Wealth In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.
Modern day slavery ‚Äúmore cruel than any beast of prey‚Äù (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.</description>
