I also really enjoy LEARNING as much as I can from other people. And so, with that in mind, I’d like to “open source” my search for mentors and invite you, dear reader, to answer at least one of the questions below.

If there are two things I hate, they are waiting and staying awake. I hate waiting.
Ask anyone who knows me. I am absolutely horrible when it comes to delayed gratification. I’ve been known to open new boxes of cereal on the way home from the store.

I’m pretty flexible at this point, but I want to do something that benefits the church. I think I would make a great Assistant Rector! 🙂
Any advice, opportunities, or connections you can offer would be appreciated!

      This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.
In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.
Note that I’m not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions.

      Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.
Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and trapped often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.
I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!
