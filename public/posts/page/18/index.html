      I love books. Books, however, do not like my back.
Can you relate?
Maybe it’s not sitting around reading books all day, but I imagine plenty of you out there suffer from back pain/fatigue.
Let me share a time-saving solution I’ve recently found: two-handed kettlebell swings.
How can these cannonballs with handles help your back?
Well, the kettlebell swing is one of the many exercises out there that activates your posterior chain – the muscles along the back of your body.

      What would it have been like, on the first Holy Saturday? What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?
All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.

      Hi internet – especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.
I’m in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.
Here’s my goal: to explore the possible relationship between Barth’s critique of the “No-God”(Nich-Gott) and Bonhoeffer’s critique(s) of viewing God as a “stopgap” (Lückenbüßer) or “working hypothesis.”
As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the Romans commentary, Garrett Green’s recent re-translation of CD §17, and Letters and Papers from Prison.

      It’s been a grueling past few weeks at Beeson. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!
Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!
I have preached twice in the past month on Psalm 32. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C, for Dr.

<p>From the church’s perspective, is the state a promising offer, or a threatening one? At the risk of breathtaking oversimplification, Anglicans have tended to adopt the former perspective, leading to accommodation, and Anabaptists the latter, resulting in separation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">1</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Following Samuel Wells in his theological appropriation of terms from theatrical improvisation, the Anglican tradition has tended to respond to the promising <em>offers</em> (invitations to respond) of the state by <em>accepting</em> – maintaining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The historical legacy of the Church of England has given Anglicanism, as Anderson notes, an “inheritance of a strong loyalty to the state and a conservatism that has led the church to promote the status quo more often than it agitates for reform.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[3]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This inheritance from the established Church of England has coincided with a dual tendency to adopt a high <em>status</em> (a strategy for getting one’s way), in terms of relative privilege and political optimism, and a low status, in terms of frequent subservience in church-state relations.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[4]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?</a>“)</p>
<p>However, the Anabaptist tradition has tended to respond to the threatening offers of the state by <em>blocking</em> – undermining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[5]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> For many contemporary Anabaptists, as Joireman summarizes, “[T]he state has the function of ordering the social world, and the church should be the visible witness of believers, the primary affiliation of Christians, and separate from the state.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[6]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Passively, blocking the state can be “a choice to shut oneself away and keep oneself unsullied by the world.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[7]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Most often, drawing upon their sixteenth-century inheritance of facing persecution from Catholics and Protestants alike, Anabaptists have adopted a low status as somewhat of a fringe movement. Actively, however, blocking can be “a choice to take up arms,” as seen during the (admittedly rare) example of high status Anabaptist opposition during the Münster Rebellion of 1534.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[8]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
