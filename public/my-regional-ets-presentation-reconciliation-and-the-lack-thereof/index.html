This year’s theme is “the theological interpretation of Scripture,” and the plenary speaker is Wheaton’s <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Daniel-Treier">Daniel J.

<p>Furthermore, if you’re free from 5:00-5:30pm on Friday, March 21, consider swinging by room S009 to hear me present <strong>“Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God.”</strong> The atonement and the unity of the Church are topics that I’m passionate about, and I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to give my first ever conference paper. Here’s the abstract: </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> If you can’t make it to my presentation, but you’re interested in the topic, check out <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/">my previous series of posts</a> and the <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof.pdf">undergraduate thesis paper</a> from which this conference paper is drawn. Also, consider buying the new paperback edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Being-Reconciliation-Theological-Systematic/dp/0567123456/">Adam J. Johnson’s <em>God’s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth</em> (T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology)</a>. It’s much cheaper than the previous hardcover edition, and without his fresh insights into the doctrine of the atonement and Barthian theology, my paper would not have been possible. </p>
<p>Finally, please attend the entire conference at Beeson if possible! <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/assets/1346/ets_southeast_2014_schedule_1_page.pdf">Here’s the full schedule</a>.</p>
