The <a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">sermon audio is now online</a>. If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, <a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">give it a listen</a>! </p>
<p>First, <a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25">here are the passages</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Psalm 121</li>
<li>Genesis 12:1-4</li>
<li>Romans 4:1-5, 13-17</li>
<li>John 3:1-17</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, make sure to <strong>ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37</strong> <a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">in the audio</a>, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again. As I was quickly reminded after the service, <strong>he does appear twice more in John’s Gospel</strong>. Oops! Next time I’ll stick to my notes and not make any extemporaneous comments about minor characters without thinking through the context first. </p>
<p>Grace and Peace</p>
