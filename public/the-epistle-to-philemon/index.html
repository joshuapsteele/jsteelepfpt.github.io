<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As the briefest member of the Pauline corpus, the epistle to Philemon is a letter of recommendation for the sake of reconciliation in which the apostle Paul brings the gospel truth of mutual participation in the body of Christ to bear on an estranged relationship – making a delicate request of his friend Philemon to receive back a certain Onesimus into full fellowship as a brother in Christ.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn14" title="">1</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comprehension of the passage’s contemporaneous Greco-Roman epistolary landscape facilitates a knowledgeable analysis of its constituent parts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn15" title="">2</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Subsequently, the interpretive insights yielded by this examination facilitate an application of the letter to the contemporary Christian church.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000bgreco-roman-lettersbspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Greco-Roman Letters<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Originally referring to “an oral communication sent by messenger,” the Hellenistic ἐπιστολή eventually encompassed a wide variety of documents – from commercial to legal, political to personal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[3]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> As Greidanus notes, the basic form of a Greco-Roman letter was tripartite, consisting of introduction/opening, body, and conclusion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[4]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first section named the sender and addressee, often including a brief greeting and “a wish for good health.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[5]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Most difficult to analyze formally, the body of Hellenistic letters was flexible enough to encompass content suited to each writing’s particular communicative act.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[6]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Finally, “greetings to persons other than the addressee, a final greeting or prayer sentence, and sometimes a date” comprised a typical conclusion to Greco-Roman epistles.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[7]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In contrast to literary essays and official documents of the day, written to general audiences apart from any relational context, Paul’s letters are more private and personal – exhibiting his pastoral concern for those to whom he was a representative of Christ and an elder in the faith.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[8]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nevertheless, the Pauline epistles arguably exceed their contemporaneous correspondence in length, structure, and didactic intent.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[9]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although Paul understandably followed the prevailing Greco-Roman form in his own letters, he nonetheless freely adapted the epistolary conventions of the day to suit his own purposes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, as O’Brien notes, although “on occasion the more intimate letters of the Hellenistic period began with a thanksgiving to the gods for personal benefits received,” Paul expanded and developed the introductory thanksgiving/blessing section in his writings more often than any writer of his day, yielding a mix of Hellenistic form with Jewish and Christian content which is present in most of his letters.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[10]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Similarly, Paul often modified the Greco-Roman form by including a concluding paranetic section of exhortation after the body of his letters.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[11]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000banalysis-of-philemonbspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Analysis of Philemon<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->An appreciation of Pauline epistolary form in Greco-Roman context yields important interpretive insights relating to both the parts and whole of the letter to Philemon, in which Paul displays remarkable tact as he advances his request for reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[12]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although lacking a definite section of paranesis, the epistle is composed of <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->an opening greeting (Philem 1-3), <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->thanksgiving/prayer (4-7), <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->body (8-22), <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->and closing (23-25).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[13]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opening-greeting">Opening Greeting</h3>
<p>Of immediate note, Paul atypically refers to himself, in the midst of an otherwise standard greeting, not as an apostle (cf. Gal 1:1) or servant (cf. Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1), but as “a prisoner of Christ Jesus” (Philem 1; NRSV) – perhaps best explained by his desire throughout “to entreat rather than command” (cf. 8-9), but also to stress Onesimus’ usefulness to him in his captivity (cf. 11-13).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn14" title=""><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[14]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Sender (“Paul…and Timothy”; Philem 1a), and addressee (“Philemon…Apphia…Archippus…and the church in your house”; 1b-2) thus identified, Paul’s signature greeting of χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη (3) functions as a benedictional transition to a section of thanksgiving and prayer (4-7), which – as elsewhere in the Pauline corpus – introduces the letter’s main themes.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn15" title=""><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[15]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<h3 id="thanksgivingprayer">Thanksgiving/Prayer</h3>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Bruce notes, “the ground of the thanksgiving and the substance of the prayer are closely related to the purpose of the letter.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[16]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Paul gives thanks to God because of Philemon’s love, faith, and refreshment of “the hearts of the saints” (Philem 5, 7). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The content of Paul’s subsequent prayer, then, is that “the sharing of [Philemon’s] faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ” (6; ESV). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the phrase ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου is better translated as “the mutual belonging which is proper to your faith,” referring to, as Wright puts it, “the mutuality of the Christian life which, springing from common participation in the body of Christ, extends beyond mere common concern into actual exchange” – a mutual belonging which lies at the heart of Paul’s argument and requests throughout the epistle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[17]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition to introducing the key themes of love/heart (cf. ἀγάπη, 4,7,9; σπλάγχνα, 7,12,20) and mutual participation (cf. κοινωνόν, 17), the thanksgiving/prayer rhetorically establishes mutual goodwill as an exordium in which Paul emphasizes characteristics of Philemon to which he can then appeal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[18]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main request of the letter’s body – of noteworthy length in its Greco-Roman context – is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Philemon should receive Onesimus just as he would receive Paul<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (17b).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[19]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->lthough Paul makes use of every persuasive tactic at his disposal – including concession of apostolic authority (8; 19b), emotional appeal (9, 12), pun (11), and appeal to honor (14) – the main thrust of the argument depends on the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->mutual belonging<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” (6) between Philemon and Onesimus now that the latter has become a Christian during Paul’s captivity (10).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[20]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regardless of the exact nature of the past estrangement (about which Paul remains virtually silent), Philemon is urged to interpret the seemingly unfortunate state of affairs as an opportunity for eternal reconciliation (15-16), transferring any debts that Onesimus had incurred to Paul’s own account instead (18). In receiving back Onesimus, Paul’s “very heart” (12b), as “a beloved brother” (16), Philemon would continue his refreshment of the saints’ hearts (7) by refreshing Paul’s heart (20).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[21]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here, then, is an analogous microcosm of the gospel itself – a fulfillment of Paul’s prayer for κοινωνία (6) and of the cruciform “ministry of reconciliation” of 2 Corinthians 5:16-21 and Colossians 1:24-29.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[22]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Wright notes, just as in Christ God reconciles the entire world to himself (2 Cor 5:19), “God is in Paul reconciling Philemon and Onesimus” – who both owed a debt, so to speak, to the apostle for their conversion (Philem 10, 19b).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[23]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Confident of Philemon’s compliance with his reconciliatory request (21), Paul makes an additional request for lodging based on Paul’s hope for release from imprisonment and subsequent travel to Colossae to be present with his audience (22) – an epistolary structure known as the “apostolic parousia,” revealing Paul’s consideration of his writings as substitutes for his physical presence.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[24]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, Paul reports the greetings of his gospel co-workers to Philemon (23-24), before reverting to the plural to include the other addressees (2) in his concluding benediction.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[25]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000bapplicationbspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Application<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the consensus interpretation that Onesimus is Philemon’s runaway slave is correct, then Deuteronomy 23:15-16 would seem to mandate that Paul <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> return the fugitive to his estranged master. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[26]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the reality of their mutual belonging in Christ compelled the apostle to facilitate the reconciliation now possible due to the Messiah’s death, burial, and resurrection (cf. 2 Cor 5:16-21). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nevertheless, Lightfoot reveals a potential hurdle for modern readers of this ancient text when he notes that, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->though “the word ‘emancipation’ seems to be trembling on [Paul’s] lips…he does not once utter it.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[27]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first step in resolving this frustration involves the clear delineation between the context of slavery in which Onesimus lived, the transatlantic slave trade of the 16<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through 19<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> centuries, and the modern day slavery of human trafficking and forced labor – for it is far too easy to conflate the three in indignation at Paul’s failure to request Onesimus’ freedom.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[28]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then, once the anachronism of expecting Paul to be a modern abolitionist is noted, it can be clearly seen that, as Bruce observes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->though the epistle to Philemon “throws little light on Paul’s attitude to the institution of slavery,” it brings “the institution into an atmosphere where it could only wilt and die.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[29]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After all, the same κοινωνία that enabled Philemon and Onesimus to be reconciled could not help but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->destroy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the dynamics of slavery within the kingdom of God and body of Christ – where “there is no longer slave or free,” but all are “one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->According to the world, Onesimus belonged to Philemon as a slave. According to Christ, they belonged to one another as brothers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although here in Philemon, as elsewhere (cf. Col 3:22-4:1), Paul stops short of prohibiting slavery, it is clear that he understood the gospel of Jesus Christ inescapably to transform the divisive condition of humanity into a restored, eternal unity which transcended all temporal divisions (cf. 1 Cor 7:17-24; Col 3:11). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul’s tactful requests reveal that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the bond between Philemon and Onesimus as brothers in the Lord<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Philem 16) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was far stronger than the social expectations of master and slave.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Transcending the issue of slavery – yet simultaneously striking at its very core – Paul’s masterfully crafted epistle to Philemon reminds Christians in every age to apply consistently the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ to their relationships, in spite of individualism’s siren song, which might tempt them to manipulate and dominate instead of to mutually belong to one another in κοινωνία. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, readers of Paul’s letter to Philemon should follow his peace-making example by seeking to be ministers of reconciliation in their respective contexts – no matter how discordant or seemingly insignificant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This brief letter thus coheres with the biblical theme of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Because God is one, his people are called to be one as well – a community of forgiven women and men, Jews and Gentiles, even slaves and masters who forgive each other’s debts and refresh each other’s hearts in the κοινωνία of their faith in Jesus their Messiah.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[30]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
