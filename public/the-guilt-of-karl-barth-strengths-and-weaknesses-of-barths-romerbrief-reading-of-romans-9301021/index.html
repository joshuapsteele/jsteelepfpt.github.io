<h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”</h2>
<p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.</p>
<p>Of course, the very worst thing about supersessionism is that it implies that God is faithless and fickle. The next-worst thing about supersessionism is that it’s only a short step away from antisemitism and anti-Judaism. And yet, if Barth’s goal and our own is to interpret the book of Romans by ascertaining what Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail,”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[3]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> then the worst thing about Barth’s somewhat supersessionist Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is not his equation of “Israel” with the “Church,” but rather his equation of “Gentiles” with the “world.” When it comes to Römerbrief chapter 10, there are actually good reasons for Barth to apply Romans 9:30–10:21 to the guilt of the Church, instead of Israel. However, glossing Paul’s “Gentiles” as the “world” makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pick up on Paul’s pastoral handling of the tensions between Jews and Gentiles within the Church. Paul is talking about the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians, whereas Barth is talking about the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>In order to make this point, I will first summarize Barth’s argument in Römerbrief 10, before assessing its strengths and weaknesses as an interpretation of Romans 10.</p>
<h2 id="summary-what-barth-is-doing-in-römerbrief-10">SUMMARY: WHAT BARTH IS DOING IN RÖMERBRIEF 10</h2>
<h3 id="the-krisis-of-knowledge-romans-930103-with-great-revelation-comes-great-culpabilitysupa-idpost-41871-footnote-ref-4-hrefpost-41871-footnote-44asup">The KRISIS of Knowledge (Romans 9:30–10:3): With Great Revelation Comes Great Culpability<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[4]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h3>
<p>The knowledge in question is the knowledge of God and the crisis is the judgment that humans are guilty. In fact, the crisis of knowledge is that both avoiding and pursuing the knowledge of God lead to guilt. <em>Avoiding</em> the knowledge of God <em>increases</em> the guilt and <em>pursuing</em> (and even receiving) the knowledge of God <em>reveals</em> the guilt. For Barth, the relationship between divine revelation and human plight is direct, not inverse.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[5]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And yet, despite this direct correlation between revelation and plight, there is no escape from the judgment of God. There is no religiously privileged position from which the Church can judge Israel or the world. And there is no religion-<em>less</em> position from which the world can judge the Church. For Barth, as it is with Israel, so it is with the Church, and so it is with the entire world of ineluctably religious human beings.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Barth usually glosses “Israel” as the “Church” and “Gentiles” as the “world.” However, we should note that Barth is making an argument from the greater to the lesser when it comes to the relationship between Israel and the Church. He admits that the pinnacle of human religion, which is already the highest human possibility, is to be found in the history of Israel, asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can there be a ‘supreme’ religion, a highest pinnacle of all human work, in the relation between God and men? If such a religion were to be found anywhere, it would be in the ‘religion’ of the prophets and psalmists of Israel, which is nowhere excelled, certainly not in the history of Christianity, and not even in the so-called ‘Religion of Jesus’.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[6]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Barth is willing to mention Israel and Christianity in a differentiated manner. And yet Barth sees no religious evolutionary progress from Judaism to Christianity. The pinnacle of religion had already been reached in the history of Israel, before the history of the Church.</p>
<p>Now, of course, for Barth, to call something the “pinnacle of religion” is a particularly damning critique! And he immediate says that “a religion adequate to revelation and congruent to the righteousness of God, a law of righteousness, is unattainable,” except through the miracle of faith.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[7]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> However, Barth is arguing that, if even Israel failed to attain the righteousness of God, then the Church will fare no better.</p>
<p>Although some might suggest that, given the direct correlation between revelation and plight, the best course of action would be to distance ourselves from the guilty Church, Barth maintains that there really is no escape from the solidarity of human beings under the judgment of God. He writes that “in the Church humanity becomes conscious of itself and is manifested as religious.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[8]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Therefore, “in describing the Church we are describing ourselves.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[9]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> After all, Barth maintains that “in the affairs of God it is impossible for one individual to range itself against another, or one person against another. We cannot examine men, and then proceed to justify some and to condemn others.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[10]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The knowledge of God, therefore, leads to a crisis, a judgment, a critique of ourselves and our best thoughts about God.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[11]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="and-yet-the-light-shines-in-the-darkness-romans-10421">And Yet, The Light Shines in the Darkness (Romans 10:4–21)</h3>
<p>Barth insists that, despite the Church’s tribulation and guilt, there is a way forward. But it is not pleasant. For Barth, “the hope of the Church” is manifest “precisely where its guilt is proven.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[12]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The stone of stumbling, the rock of offense, is the only way forward. That is, in order to see the light of God that shines in the darkness, the Church must accept the judgment of God as her own, instead of trying to escape the judgment.</p>
<p>After all, on its own, the Church is desperately incapable. It is unable to have faith. It is unable to “do the law,” which, for Barth, means comprehending “that human righteousness comes into being only through the majesty of the nearness of God and of His election.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[13]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Church is unable to bring Christ near or to make Christ present. The Church can’t even negate its way to God!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[14]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Instead, the light shines in the darkness because God himself has already drawn near in Jesus Christ. Not, mind you, in a way that can be grasped and claimed by the Church as a possession. But, nevertheless, in an eschatological nearness that enables all human beings to call upon the Lord Jesus Christ and accept both the judgment and the salvation of God.</p>
<p>And yet, the light shines in “real darkness.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[15]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Barth writes that “what is demanded of us here is that we should know that we are understood by God—in our lack of understanding.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[16]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> We best serve the Church by reminding it that even this demand exceeds its grasp. For Barth, we must not minimize but must instead emphasize “that the tribulation of the Church is its guilt, and that its guilt consists in a perpetual avoiding of the tribulation which it suffers from the secret of God.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[17]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> “The Church needs to be continually reminded of the most serious of all symptoms. It was the Church, not the world, which crucified Christ.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[18]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Römerbrief chapter 10 was written as just such a reminder. With great revelation comes great culpability.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-what-should-we-make-of-barths-reading">ASSESSMENT: WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF BARTH’S READING?</h2>
<p>So much for a summary sketch of chapter 10. Let’s now assess Barth’s argument.</p>
<h3 id="first-barth-was-right-to-critique-the-church">First, Barth Was Right to Critique the Church.</h3>
<p>Previously, in chapter 9, Barth wrote that “in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[19]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The first time I read those words, I’m pretty sure my jaw hit the ground. And yet, I believe that Karl Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 to critique the Church instead of critiquing Israel. He was right, in other words, to interpret Paul’s words “to all God’s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints” (Rom. 1:7) as an internal critique of the Church rather than an external critique of Israel.</p>
<p>And, as far as an internal critique of the Church goes, I believe that Barth gives some very good advice to the Church. Instead of grasping for a religiously privileged position that does not exist, Barth urges the Church to submit to the judgment of God. Like a good prophet, he calls the people of God to repent. Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgment; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgment; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences—and certainly one day purified of some of them—it would be the Church of God.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[20]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this sounds like Paul, who, right after proclaiming that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes (Rom. 1:16–17), then proceeds to cut everyone down to size by reminding them that there’s no human path to the righteousness of God apart from submitting to the judgment of God (1:18–3:20). Humble repentance, not positivistic boasting, is the correct human response to God’s gracious salvation.</p>
<p>I largely agree with what Gaventa recently argued at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[21]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> On the one hand, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is dangerous, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and wrong, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.” Yet, on the other hand, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 flows naturally from his emphasis on human solidarity and the qualitative difference between God and humanity in his reading of Romans 1–8. Furthermore, Barth’s prophetic and pastoral indictment of Christian arrogance coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[22]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> As Gaventa pointed out, throughout the letter, Paul appears to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to erase those lines.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[23]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In his critique of the guilty Church in Römerbrief 10, Barth is at least attempting to take the same posture as Paul. As a Jewish Christian writing to Christians in Rome, Paul took a posture of self-critique and solidarity with Israel. Barth therefore takes a posture of self-critique and solidarity with the Church.</p>
<h3 id="and-yet-barth-was-wrong-to-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church">And Yet, Barth Was Wrong to Miss the Jew-Gentile Tensions WITHIN the Church.</h3>
<p>Exegetically speaking, using Romans 9:30–10:21 to critique the Church at least plausibly depends on Paul’s admission in the following chapter that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” as “an apostle to the Gentiles” (11:13). That is, the Gentiles among his predominantly Gentile Christian audience at Rome. At this point, we should recall that, in Romans 9:30–10:21, Paul is in the second stage of his argument that “It is not as though the word of God had failed” (9:6a). The first stage of his argument (9:6–29) was that “not all Israelites truly belong to Israel” (9:6b), “and not all of Abraham’s children are his true descendants” (9:7a). That is, membership in the people of God has always been determined by God’s gracious election—nothing else.</p>
<p>But what was the problem that necessitated this argument in the first place? Why, in other words, would anyone think that the word of God had failed? We get the answer in Romans 9:30–31: “Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith; but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.” I take Paul to be referring to the fact that, at that time, the Church was becoming more prominently Gentile, and that the message concerning Jesus as the Messiah was getting a better hearing, as it were, among Gentiles than among Jews.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[24]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> If the gospel were “the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek” (1:16), then why was it receiving such a relatively poor hearing among the Jews? Did this imply some kind of faithlessness on God’s part? Had his word to his chosen people failed (9:6)? Was God being unjust (9:14)? Had God rejected his people (11:1)?</p>
<p>Paul’s answer to these questions in Romans 9–11 is an emphatic “No!” He argues for continuity in the saving works of God, despite the apparent discontinuity in the response of Jews and Gentiles to Jesus the Messiah. This argument about God’s faithfulness, then, has implications for both Jewish and Gentile believers—a mixture reflected in the original audience of Paul’s letter.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Paul elegantly interweaves critiques of Jewish and Gentile Christians throughout his letter. Here, in Romans 9–11, after critiquing the majority of Israel for not pursuing the “law of righteousness. . . on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works” (9:31–32), Paul springs a rhetorical trap, as it were, and accuses Gentile Christians of being no better than Jews (11:11–32). These critiques play a role in laying the foundation for what Paul has to say in Romans 12–16, especially to the “strong” and the “weak” in chapters 14 and 15.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[25]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The pastoral heart of the book of Romans is arguably Paul’s exhortation to Jewish and Gentile Christians to “welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God” (15:7).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[26]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In Romans 9:30–10:21, then, Paul is critiquing Israel for failing to follow her Law to its <em>telos</em>, Jesus the Messiah. But he is doing so in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Church. Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel should play for a Christian audience. So, although he should have said more about Israel, perhaps focusing on the Church in Römerbrief 10 was justified.</p>
<p>However, when Barth equates “Gentiles” with “the world” in Romans 9–11, he is sawing-off the exegetical branch he is sitting on. Paul’s critique of Gentile Christians vis-a-vis Israel in chapter 11 is the most immediate exegetical justification for applying the critique of Israel in chapters 9 and 10 to the Church. But, according to Barth, the “Gentiles” are “those outside” the Church. Commenting on Romans 9:30 (“What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith”), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness. . . . How can it be that the Gentiles, when confronted with the Church, are, and remain, Gentiles?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[27]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Barth’s theological conclusions about the relationship between the Church and the world might be legitimate. But the fact remains that this is almost completely the opposite of what was most likely in the background to Romans 9:30–10:21. It was the Church’s relative success among the Gentiles and relative failure among the Jews that Paul had in mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Barth might be correct in his refusal to identify and quantify who is “in” and who is “out” when it comes to God’s gracious election. But, for Paul and his audience, “Jews,” “Gentiles,” the “strong,” the “weak,” and “doing the law” at least had concrete, visible ramifications. These things were not merely eschatological.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[28]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:12–13 (“For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved’”), Barth writes: “But are these men within the Church, or outside it, or are they members of some Church of their own founding? The question is trivial.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[29]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Why trivial? Because Barth maintains that these “faithful heathen” are an “eschatological quantity.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[30]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I disagree. Although Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God, he is guilty of overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[31]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Although Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 as an internal critique of the Church, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 10 and Romans 9–11 is that, while Paul is speaking about Israel in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians, Barth is speaking about the Church’s relationship to the world.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[32]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Borrowing Barth’s words from his preface to the English translation of Römerbrief, we might ask, after reading chapter 10 of the Romans commentary, “Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which [Barth has] interpreted him as thinking and speaking?” My answer would have to be “yes and no.” Yes, in general, but no in detail. Yes, in form, but no in content.</p>
<p>Yes, the internal critique of the Church is Paul’s. But, no, Paul was not primarily talking about the relationship between the Church and the world. He was primarily talking about the Church. Yes, Paul brought Jew and Gentile alike together under the judgment and the salvation of God. But, for Paul, the guilt of the Church was not its ignorance of its dialectical relationship with the world. Instead, for Paul, the Church is guilty primarily because of its internal divisions.</p>
<p>Is there a way to bring Paul and Barth together in Romans 9:30–10:21? I think and hope so. We might arrive at the same destination, with regards to the relationship between the Church and the world, but I think that, when reading Romans, we need to start with the divisions that exist within the Church. With great revelation comes great culpability. The Church cannot comprehend the nature of her division and divisiveness apart from her knowledge of God. “There is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all” (10:12). And yet the Church cannot afford to erase or forget the distinction between Jew and Greek from her own internal history.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[33]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Within the Church, the light of Christian unity shines, but it shines in divided and divisive darkness.</p>
