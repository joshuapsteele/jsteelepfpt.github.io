<p>In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Book of Common Prayer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1662 Book of Common Prayer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the marriage vows read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,</strong><br>
<strong>from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I N. take thee M. to my wedded huſband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love, cheriſh, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we got married in August 2012, my wife, Rachel, and I decided to write our own vows, at least loosely based upon the traditional vows. (Give us a break, we weren’t yet Anglicans!)</p>
<p>So, here are the vows I wrote, and still endeavor to keep as Rachel’s husband!</p>
<h1 id="my-wedding-vows">My Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>I, Joshua Patrick Steele, pledge myself to you, Rachel Elizabeth, as your husband.</p>
<p>I solemnly vow:</p>
