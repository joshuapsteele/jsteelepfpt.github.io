<p>I’m writing <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">my dissertation on Barth, Bonhoeffer, the Bible, and “religion.”</a> However, getting clear on just what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by “religion” is a huge challenge. It’s what I devoted <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/">my entire writing sample</a> to examining, and I plan to devote an entire chapter of my dissertation to the topic.</p>
<p>Neither Barth nor Bonhoeffer used the word “religion” in the way that we’re prone to use the word in everyday speech today. <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion">According to Merriam-Webster, “religion” means</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the state of a religious (example: a nun in her 20th year of religion)</li>
<li>the service and worship of God or the supernatural</li>
<li>commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance</li>
<li>a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices</li>
<li>(archaic) : scrupulous conformity : CONSCIENTIOUSNESS</li>
<li>a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Donald McKim’s <em>The Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms</em>, “religion” is</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For Barth? Religion is idolatrous “unbelief” or “faithlessness” (<em>Unglaube</em> in German). For Bonhoeffer? Well, as Ralf Wüstenberg has noted, Bonhoeffer’s description of “religion” changed over time, but in his <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>, he described religion in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Religion emphasizes inwardness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion emphasizes conscience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is a temporary phenomenon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is manipulative and exploitative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion minimizes human strength/knowledge/autonomy and instead focuses on human weakness, ignorance, and boundaries/limits/limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is metaphysical, otherworldly, and escapist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is privileged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is, like circumcision, no longer a condition for salvation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion posits a false “God” (a “deus ex machina,” “working hypothesis,” and “stopgap”) on the other side of human boundaries (a shrinking area, as humanity matures) in order to solve human problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is driven by anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is individualistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religious language has lost its power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is a particular posture towards life, capable of being exemplified, not only by pastors, but also by existential philosophers and psychotherapists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion is a partial and segmented posture towards life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religion ignores the world’s increasing godlessness.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, to get a taste of what I’m working with, I think that the following two passages from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Theology-Reader-Alister-McGrath/dp/1118874382/">Alister McGrath’s <em>The Christian Theology Reader</em> (5th edition)</a> are helpful.</p>
<p>McGrath gives the following prefatory remarks to the Bonhoeffer excerpt:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the excerpt from Bonhoeffer (PDF).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve drawn the text below from my Logos edition of Bonhoeffer’s works. This is from Bonhoeffer’s letter to Eberhard Bethge on July 16, 1944.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>McGrath then adds the following “comment” to the reading:</p>

<p>Here’s McGrath’s prefatory remarks for the Barth passage:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the excerpt(s) from Barth (PDF).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve drawn the text below from my Logos edition of Barth’s <em>Church Dogmatics</em>. These passages come from §17, “The Revelation of God as the <em>Aufhebung</em> (traditionally translated “abolition”) of Religion.” It might be helpful to note that the <em>Leitsatz</em> (the thesis statement, if you will) for this section reads: “The revelation of God in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the judging but also reconciling presence of God in the world of human religion, that is, in the realm of man’s attempts to justify and to sanctify himself before a capricious and arbitrary picture of God. The Church is the locus of true religion, so far as through grace it lives by grace.”</p>
<p>OK, here’s Barth:</p>
