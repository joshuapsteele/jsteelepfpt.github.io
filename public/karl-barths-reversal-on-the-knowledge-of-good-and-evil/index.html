<p>Specifically, in <em>Romans</em> (240–57, esp. 246–51), Barth interpreted “the knowledge of good and evil” as the divine secret that humans are merely humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby concealed the creator/creature distinction</li>
<li>and was meant to enable a direct relationship between God and humans.</li>
<li>Instead, human disobedience revealed the distinction</li>
<li>and led to the rise of religion as worship of God, an independent action over against their creator.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>Church Dogmatics</em> (esp. CD III/1, 257–76, but also IV/1, 418–78), Barth interpreted the knowledge of good and evil as God’s prerogative to judge between what ought to be and what ought not to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby revealed the creator/creature distinction</li>
<li>and was meant to prompt humans to acknowledge and praise their creator—to worship God in a proper way.</li>
<li>Instead, humans disobediently attempted to abolish the distinction.</li>
<li>This led to the rise of religion as improper worship—the self-exalting, self-justifying, and self-helping positing of false gods.</li>
