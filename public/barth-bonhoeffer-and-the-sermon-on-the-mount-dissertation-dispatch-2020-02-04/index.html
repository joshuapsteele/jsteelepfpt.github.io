<p>Given the importance of the Sermon on Mount for Bonhoeffer’s life and work, I’m persuaded that there’s something important to be found here—something that will hopefully shed some light on the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship re:their theological critiques of religion.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are at least two other tidbits that have me interested in how Barth and Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p><a href="https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/read-the-letter-dietrich-bonhoeffer-wrote-to-gandhi/">On October 17, 1934, Bonhoeffer wrote to Gandhi,</a> inquiring about the possibility of going to India in order to learn how to develop “a truly spiritual living Christian peace movement.” In that letter, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bonhoeffer to Gandhi, October 17, 1934<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On September 19, 1936, Bonhoeffer wrote the following to Karl Barth. He is commenting on their lack of communication since the fall of 1933.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bonhoeffer to Barth, September 19, 1936 (DBWE 14:252-253), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emphasis added<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, what’s really intriguing to me is *why* Bonhoeffer would think, in 1934–36, that Barth’s interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount was insufficient. Was this just a general sense, based upon familiarity with Barth’s theology? Or did Bonhoeffer have some particular Barthian exegesis in mind?</p>
