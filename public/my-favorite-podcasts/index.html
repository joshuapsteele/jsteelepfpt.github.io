<p>Although podcasts (think “iPod” + “broadcast”) have been around for over a decade, we’re living in a bit of a golden age – or a least a Rennaissance – of the medium. For the uninitiated, here’s a nice video about what podcasts are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oerm5Q_9u2A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oerm5Q_9u2A</a></p>
<p>Currently, podcasts are one of my very favorite ways to consume information about a wide variety of topics. Sure, gun to my head, I’ll choose books over podcasts as a way to learn. However, unlike books (or videos), you can easily listen to podcasts while doing other things – whether folding laundry, washing dishes, or going for a run/walk.</p>
<p>(Note: as I mentioned in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/tools">my list of favorite tools and apps</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> is my current favorite podcast player. Although, there are plenty of other worthy podcast players/managers to check out!)</p>
<p>There are no shortage of podcasts, or lists of best podcasts, for that matter. However, here are my current favorites.</p>
<h1 id="my-favorite-podcasts">My Favorite Podcasts:</h1>
<h2 id="up-first-npr3"><a href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first">Up First (NPR)</a></h2>
<p>This is the first podcast I listen to every weekday while making coffee. I love that it’s short (˜10 minutes) and that it provides some snapshots of important news stories that day. In addition to Up First, I frequently listen to NPR newscasts via their <a href="http://one.npr.org/">NPR One app</a>, which is worth checking out!</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-manliness5"><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/">The Art of Manliness</a></h2>
<p>Sure, the egalitarian in me wishes there were a show out there called “The Art of Humanity” – about how to be a _Mensch. _However, in the meantime, Brett McKay has a solid podcast going about “reviving the lost art of manliness.” I enjoy the podcast (and t<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/">he Art of Manliness website</a>) because it includes so many helpful how-to guides – for everything from weightlifting to men’s fashion.</p>
<h2 id="word--table7"><a href="https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/">Word &amp; Table</a></h2>
<p>I created <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a> as a way of making Anglicanism more accessible. This podcast, Word &amp; Table, has much the same mission, although it’s focus is not just on Anglicanism, but rather on the rich Christian tradition of liturgical worship. As I wrote about the podcast <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/listen-to-the-word-table-podcast-to-learn-more-about-liturgical-and-sacramental-christian-worship/">over at Rookie Anglican</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to their <a href="https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/">website</a>, Word &amp; Table “is a weekly podcast about liturgy, sacrament, and the great tradition of Christian worship and why it is vital in our world today.”</p>
<p>The podcast was started back in October 2016, and it’s hosted by <a href="http://www.greenhousemovement.com/team/alex-wilgus/">Alex Wilgus</a> and Fr. <a href="http://www.churchrez.org/staff/profile/stephengauthier">Stephen Gauthier</a>, the Canon Theologian for the Anglican Church in North America’s Diocese of the Upper Midwest.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to the podcast via <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/word-table/id1161203280?mt=2">iTunes</a>, listen to episodes via the <a href="https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/">Word &amp; Table website</a>, or simply search for “Word and Table” in your podcast player/manager of choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve got questions about anything related to the Christian tradition, check out the Word &amp; Table podcast to see if they have an episode on the topic!</p>
<h2 id="the-tim-ferriss-show13"><a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">The Tim Ferriss Show</a></h2>
<p>I’ve become somewhat of a Tim Ferriss junkie in the past two years. In addition to this podcast – which features long-form interviews with “top performers,” in which Tim distils tips, tricks, habits, and practices for the common person – Ferriss’ books are well worth checking out (Affiliate LInks: <a href="http://amzn.to/2uTWui7">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>; The <a href="http://amzn.to/2uxKdxq">4-Hour Body</a>; The <a href="http://amzn.to/2h0dtJT">4-Hour Chef</a>; <a href="http://amzn.to/2h0dwp3">Tools of Titans</a>) . He’s great at teaching _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning">metalearning</a> _– how to learn how to learn!</p>
<p>(Note: Tim Ferriss is how I found out about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/05/25/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/">kettlebells</a> – one of my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/tools">favorite tools</a> for personal fitness.)</p>
<h2 id="coffee-break-german20"><a href="https://radiolingua.com/coffeebreakgerman/">Coffee Break German</a></h2>
<p>Sure, Coffee Break German hasn’t taught me the kind of German that I’ll need for my Ph.D. German translation exam. However, it is a very informative introduction to basic/conversational German. It makes a wonderful companion to Duolingo for language learning! Radio Lingua Network offers <a href="https://radiolingua.com/">a whole suite of “Coffee Break” languages</a>, including French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese!</p>
<h2 id="this-american-life22"><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, no podcast beats This American Life in terms of the quality and variety of storytelling. It’s well worth your time, in addition to the “spinoff” shows <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> and <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/">S-Town</a>.</p>
