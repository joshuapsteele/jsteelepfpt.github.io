<li><strong>When faced with provocation to respond to what someone has said, give it five minutes</strong>. Take a walk, or weed the garden, or chop some vegetables. Get your body involved: your body knows the rhythms to live by, and if your mind falls into your body’s rhythm, you’ll have a better chance of thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Value learning over debating</strong>. Don’t “talk for victory.”</li>
<li>As best you can, online and off, <strong>avoid the people who fan flames</strong>.</li>
<li>Remember that <strong>you don’t have to respond to what everyone else is responding to in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>If you <em>do</em> have to respond to what everyone else is responding to</strong> in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness, or else lose your status in your community, then you should realize that <strong>it’s not a community but rather an <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">Inner Ring</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gravitate</strong> as best you can, in every way you can, <strong>toward people who seem to value genuine community and can handle disagreement with equanimity</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Seek out the best and fairest-minded of people whose views you disagree with.</strong> Listen to them for a time without responding. Whatever they say, <em>think it over</em>.</li>
<li>Patiently, and as honestly as you can, <strong>assess your <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repugnance">repugnances</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Sometimes <strong>the “ick factor”</strong> is telling; sometimes it’s a distraction from what matters.</li>
<li>Beware of <strong>metaphors</strong> and <strong>myths</strong> that do too much heavy cognitive lifting; notice what your <strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terministic_screen">terministic screens</a>“</strong> [See pages 90–91] are directing your attention to-and what they’re directing your attention <em>away from</em>; look closely for hidden metaphors and beware the power of myth.</li>
<li>Try to <strong>describe others’ positions in the language that <em>they</em> use, without indulging in in-other-wordsing.</strong> [See pg. 106: “We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, ‘In other words, you’re saying … ‘ And inevitably the argument, when put <em>in other words</em>, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked.]</li>
<li>Be <strong>brave</strong>.</li>
