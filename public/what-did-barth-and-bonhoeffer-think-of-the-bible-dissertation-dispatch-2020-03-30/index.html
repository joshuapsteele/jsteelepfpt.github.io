<p>In order to answer these questions (or at least move toward an answer), I’ve spent a considerable amount of time looking for specific biblical passages that (1) both Barth and Bonhoeffer discussed (2) at least thematically in relation to their theological critiques of religion. Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7 (the Sermon on the Mount) have emerged as the most relevant passages in this regard.</p>
<p>However, there’s also the question of method and how Barth and Bonhoeffer “dogmatically located” Scripture. Consider what John Webster had to say about Barth, Bonhoeffer, the Bible, and the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, although Jameson Ross (in his 2019 Durham PhD dissertation, “Bonhoeffer’s Ecclesial Hermeneutic: The Practice of Biblical Interpretation in 1930s Germany”) has demonstrated much more <em>continuity</em> in Bonhoeffer’s biblical interpretation (specifically, between Bonhoeffer’s 1925 student paper on “The Historical and Pneumatological Interpretation of Scripture” and his 1935 “Contemporizing New Testament Texts”) than Webster saw, I believe that Webster was right to emphasize the following about Bonhoeffer’s biblical work:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Webster applies this to Bonhoeffer’s post-<em>Creation and Fall</em> biblical work, but I would, following Jameson Ross’s dissertation, apply it to <em>Creation and Fall</em> as well.</p>
<p>This directness—or “exegetical immediacy,” as I’ve taken to calling it—is, I believe, a distinguishing feature of Bonhoeffer’s exegesis. Sure, he may have gotten some of it from Barth’s trailblazing work in the area of theological exegesis. But I think that Bonhoeffer is even more comfortable with exegetical immediacy than Barth.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to <em>Creation and Fall</em>, Bonhoeffer is comfortable with making direct moves from Eden to today. Barth, on the other hand, only wants to move from Eden to Israel to Jesus to the Church to today. Barth is, in other words, more attentive to the contours of salvation history, as it were, than Bonhoeffer is—at least when it comes to the passages regarding Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7 that I’ve looked at.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m not sure I agree with the assessment of Michael Mawson in his essay on “Scripture” in <em>The Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer</em>. Commenting on Bonhoeffer’s 1925 student paper on scriptural interpretation, Mawson writes that “Bonhoeffer’s early essay is perhaps best read as an enthusiastic endorsement of and expansion on this key Barthian claim” (that the Bible tells us what God says to us, not what humans have said about God, pg. 125). However, Mawson then stresses the influence of Luther:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don’t doubt or quibble with Luther’s influence on Bonhoeffer, but I wonder if this is the best way of stating the Luther-vs-Barth difference. It seems to me that Barth only becomes more and more concerned with the historicity of the Bible, at least when it comes to the contours of the covenant between God and humanity in Christ. On the other hand, Bonhoeffer appears to become less concerned with the historical contours <em>within</em> Scripture, and more concerned with present day history and what the Word of God has to say.</p>
<p>Another way that I’m thinking about this is as follows. At least one part of Bonhoeffer’s accusation of Barth’s <em>Offenbarungspositivismus</em> (in the prison letters) is that Barth flattens various doctrines to the same level of significance. Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If Bonhoeffer accuses Barth of flattening out the contours of various levels of doctrinal significance, I wonder if Barth could charge Bonhoeffer with flattening out the contours of salvation history and moving from texts to the present day too quickly, without taking the intervening history of Israel and/or the Church into account.</p>
<p>To be sure, Bonhoeffer does <em>not</em> do this on the basis of extrapolating universal principles from Scripture in order to move from the historical text to the present. In his 1935 lecture on “con temporizing New Testament texts,” Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Bonhoeffer takes a Lutheran “was Christum treibet” approach to the Bible. This is not to say that Barth’s handling of Scripture isn’t also Christological! But it does seem to me that, when commenting upon a passage of Scripture, especially one in the Old Testament, Bonhoeffer wants to get to Christ more quickly and directly than Barth.</p>
