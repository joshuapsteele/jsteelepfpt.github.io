<p>**O God, Creator of all that is,<br>
** **From the treasures of Your wisdom,<br>
** **You have arrayed the universe with marvelous order,<br>
** **And now govern with skill and might.<br>
** <strong>You are the true fount of light and wisdom.</strong></p>
<p>**Pour forth a ray of Your brightness<br>
** **Into the darkened places of our minds;<br>
** **Disperse from our souls the twofold darkness into which we were born:<br>
** <strong>Sin and ignorance.</strong></p>
<p>**Grant to each of us:<br>
** **Deftness of hand,<br>
** **Keenness of mind,<br>
** **Skill in learning,<br>
** **Subtlety to interpret,<br>
** <strong>And eloquence in speech.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And since you have given us the privilege to share in the loving, healing, reconciling mission of Your Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, in this age and wherever we are,</strong></p>
<p>**May your Spirit make us wise;<br>
** **May your Spirit guide us;<br>
** **May your Spirit renew us;<br>
** <strong>May your Spirit strengthen us.</strong></p>
<p>**So that we will be<br>
** **Strong in faith,<br>
** **Discerning in proclamation,<br>
** **Courageous in witness,<br>
** <strong>Persistent in good deeds.</strong></p>
<p>**May You guide the beginning of our work,<br>
** **Direct its progress,<br>
** **And bring it to completion.<br>
** **You who bring all that is good to its proper end,<br>
** **Now prosper the work of our hands.<br>
** <strong>Through Jesus Christ our Lord,</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Amen</em>.</strong></p>
