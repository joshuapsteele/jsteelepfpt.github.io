<p>My theme lately has been to write on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Karl Barth and the unity of the Church<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At last year's Regional ETS (hosted by my seminary, <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>), I presented an edited version of my undergraduate thesis: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/steele-southeast-ets-2014-paper-final-presesntation-edit.pdf">Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God</a>. Click the link if you'd like to read the PDF. Here's the thesis:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That paper was a blast to write, because I got to take the doctoral work of my professor (and friend) <a href="http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/about/people/faculty/adam-johnson/">Adam J. Johnson</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Being-Reconciliation-Theological-Systematic/dp/0567123456">God's Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth</a>, now available in paperback!) and &ldquo;build&rdquo; an atonement theory based upon the divine perfection of oneness/unity. I hope to expand on that work, drawing upon other theologians than Johnson and Barth, expanding my exegetical arguments for the atonement theory's legitimacy, considering practical implications for ecumenical efforts, etc.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This year, I have submitted a slightly edited version of my final paper fora seminar on the Theology of Karl Barth taught by Piotr Malysz last Fall at Beeson. The Barthian analogy is taking Barth's definition of sin as ontological impossibility — the impossible possibility — and transferring it to thought and speech about the Church. It's a relatively simple idea, with profound ramifications (in my humble opinion) for ecumenical efforts. Here's the abstract:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I believe this is an important topic to discuss because, as I put it, &ldquo;<strong><em>each community’s self-examination and pursuit of Christ’s unifying summons will only be as rigorous as its understanding of the absurdity of church fragmentation.</em></strong>&rdquo; That is, we're only going to put effort into being unified as Christ's Church if we have a robust understanding of just how ABSURD division is within the Body of Christ!</p>
<p>If you're interested in this topic, but you can't make it to Lithonia, GA on March 27-28, feel free to read my paper here:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
