<h1 id="rucking--running">Rucking &gt; Running</h1>
<p>It took me a <em>long</em> time to “fall in love” with running. It did not take me nearly as long to fall <em>out</em> of love with running!</p>
<p>And yet, even though I’ve long enjoyed <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/">doing kettlebell swings</a> and doing <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">the 5×5 weight-lifing workout</a>, I did begin to miss the benefits of cardio training.</p>
<p>Enter <em>rucking</em>.</p>
<p>I first heard about <em>rucking</em>—carrying a weighted pack on your back—as a form of personal fitness over at <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-benefits-of-rucking/">The Art of Manliness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rucking is simple. So simple, it’s stupid.<br>
Get a backpack.<br>
Put some weight in said backpack.<br>
Put on the backpack.<br>
Start walking.<br>
That’s it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="want-to-get-started-here8217s-how-to-ruck-on-a-budget">Want to Get Started? Here’s How to Ruck on a Budget</h1>
<p>To get started with rucking, I first used my old backpack and a couple dumbbells. This worked fine, but I didn’t like how the dumbbells dug into my lower back.</p>
<p>So, I did some research about rucking on a budget, and I found <a href="http://www.mettleforger.com/how-to-ruck-on-a-budget/">this very helpful blogpost: “How to: Ruck on a Budget.”</a> There’s also <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/a-guide-to-rucking-my-favorite-low-cost-frugal-exercise-activity/">this piece at The Simple Dollar: A Guide to Rucking, My Favorite Low-Cost Exercise Activity.</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I picked different gear. Here’s my current rucking setup:</p>
<h2 id="backpack-la-police-gear-3-day-backpack-20">Backpack: LA Police Gear 3 Day Backpack 2.0</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This backpack has held up great for me so far. I use it regularly for rucking, and also <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/dangerous-beauty-phoenix-grand-canyon-trip-2018/">took it with me out to the Grand Canyon, where it performed admirably</a>. I love that it includes a waist and chest strap, as well as a convenient opening for a hydration pack.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://lapolicegear.com/diplomat-3-day-backpack1.html">buy this pack from LA Police Gear directly</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/2JsKE2C">it’s also available on Amazon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hydration-pack-source-outdoor-widepac-hydration-system-reservoir-with-helix-bite-valve-2-liter">Hydration Pack: Source Outdoor Widepac Hydration System Reservoir with Helix Bite Valve, 2-Liter</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I sweat a <em>lot</em>, so I figured that it would be nice to have a reliable hydration pack to take with me while rucking.</p>
<p>So far, this 2-liter hydration pack from Source has NOT disappointed me!</p>
<h2 id="weight-bricks-and-duct-tape">Weight: Bricks and Duct Tape</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I believe that the bricks I currently use came from Home Depot. I could be mistaken, but I think that I have 6 of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Holland-7-75-in-x-4-in-x-1-75-in-River-Red-Concrete-Paver-22051EA/100619492">these Holland 7.75 in. x 4 in. x 1.75 in. River Red Concrete Paver</a> bricks. Currently, they’re listed for $0.58 each.</p>
<p>As for duct tape, I’m pretty sure I used good ol’ fashioned Duck Brand duct tape.</p>
<p>I also used some <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/office/bubble-wrap/1229749_2696828_1478303_5636662">bubble wrap that I picked up at Walmart</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="http://news.goruck.com/event-news/wrapping-bricks-explained/">a helpful guide to wrapping bricks from GoRuck</a>.</p>
<h2 id="to-position-the-bricks-2-foam-yoga-blocksbricks">To Position the Bricks: 2 Foam Yoga Blocks/Bricks</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don’t think this is necessary, but I went out and bought <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/YOGA-BLOCK-BLUE/54193774">two foam yoga blocks/bricks from Walmart</a> in order to position the bricks a bit higher in the backpack.</p>
<p>You could also go with these from Amazon. Just make sure that the yoga blocks are big enough to support the stack of bricks you end up using (or whatever other weights you end up using).</p>
