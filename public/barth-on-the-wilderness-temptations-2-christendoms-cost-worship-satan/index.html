He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus' sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.</p>
<p>Christ's <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation was to turn stones into bread</a>, thereby using divine power as a &ldquo;technical instrument&rdquo; to save and maintain his own life. Today's temptation contains an incisive critique of Christendom's desire for influence, relevance, and power.</p>

<p>Barth gets right to the point, interpreting this temptation. Notice again the theme of abandoning repentance:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Terrible, right? But consider how pragmatism rears its ugly head!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>OK, so even then, the phrase &ldquo;undeniable overlordship of evil&rdquo; sounds quite nasty. But Barth is driving home an incisive critique of Christendom — the unholy marriage between the Kingdom of God and the kingdoms of humanity and the Devil.</p>
<p>The following question is haunting. I am particularly struck by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;ecumenical.&rdquo; If we are not careful, isn't this almost exactly what many Christians desire? How far are we willing to go to obtain influence and power?</p>

<p><strong>And we can still fall prey to this temptation, without completely giving up our God! Just worship God and bow the knee, even secretly, to Satan. Sure, you can still be pious. Just achieve your piety's ends through the gears and cogs of the world-machine! You want to be relevant? Hitch your goals to a movement, a political party, a military!</strong></p>

<p>Stay tuned for tomorrow's temptation, which Barth considers the most astonishing: &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
