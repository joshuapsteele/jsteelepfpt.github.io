<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse immediately preceding this morning’s lesson, James 1:27, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong><em>religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world</em></strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->purity from the world<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em> on one hand, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->social justice for the oppressed<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the other. And yet, in a world which is stained by rampant injustice, <strong>these are not two different pursuits, but different facets of the same agenda</strong>. Just as we must not allow the manifold sins of the world to stain our souls, we must take care to not allow the deathly and selfish perspectives of the world to stain our vision!</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps Bible] is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just a book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->see much more<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps altar] is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just a table<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bread<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->see much more<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This [gestures to room] is <strong>more</strong> than mere <!-- raw HTML omitted -->meditation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Our God is <strong>more</strong> than a divinized <!-- raw HTML omitted -->delusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><strong>We have wiped the world’s mud out of our eyes, to see more clearly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very good!</strong></p>
<p>The world says that a poor, homeless, drug-addled woman is a broken human being. We <strong>agree</strong>.</p>
<p>The world says that a rich, well-dressed, influential man is a less-broken human being, or at least broken in a more comfortable way.</p>
<p>We <strong>agree</strong>. Or at least we’re constantly tempted to in the everyday moments of our lives! Sure, theoretically, in the midst of a homily perhaps, we’d give the right answer. But practically, brothers and sisters, we’re <em><strong>partial</strong></em>. Our vision is still <em><strong>stained</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We’ve been wooed by the world’s wisdom.</p>
<p>We allow the stratified contents and contours of the world <!-- raw HTML omitted -->around<!-- raw HTML omitted --> us to dictate the distinctions <!-- raw HTML omitted -->among<!-- raw HTML omitted --> us.</p>
<p>We make evil judgments – very subtle, to be sure, but just so, that much more evil judgments! – based on the way things <em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em>.</p>
<p>We are naïve newcomers to the law of liberty – to the law which gives freedom <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have been<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as long as we can remember, and freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->once were<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in a garden unstained by Sin and Death. A freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ought to be<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and will be in a city illuminated by Christ himself.</p>
<p>Christ himself, the One of whom Isaiah spoke thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins”</em></strong> (Isaiah 11:1-5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friends, the rich are not inherently evil because of their possessions. We know this. They, <strong>we</strong>, have their own pains and problems, which we will need to address thoughtfully as a church providentially located in one of the world’s most affluent communities – and <strong>this is no easy task</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> it would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->easy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for us to allow the stratified realities around us to stain our vision, to keep us short-sighted, to keep us complacent that <strong>it would be just as unusual for the homeless and shabbily-clothed to join <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our<!-- raw HTML omitted --> community</strong> (really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->join<!-- raw HTML omitted --> us, not just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->visit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), <strong>as it would be for the rich and well-dressed to have joined the earliest Christians, or many of our impoverished brothers and sisters around the world today</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us fight hard against this subtle temptation.</p>
<p>Let us consider how we should best love and welcome those the world <!-- raw HTML omitted -->calls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->treats<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sees<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as “<em><strong>the least</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Let us <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->disagree<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->! And <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->see much more<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>Let us treat them as “<em><strong>the loved</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
