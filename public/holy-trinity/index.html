<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One God. Three persons. The Holy Trinity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The orthodox paradox of this Christian confession confounds many, due to its apparent contradictions, abstractions, and absence from Scripture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->From Arius to Augustine and beyond, trinitarian debates have raged even among those who agree that God exists, that the Bible is true, and that it is therefore worthwhile to consider what the Bible says because it reveals the existent God. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although the best discussions of the Trinity begin with an acknowledgment of its inscrutable mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason’s highest reach, a sober analysis of the doctrine’s canonical presence and historical outworking may help to answer the charges that the Trinity is a nonsensical, unbiblical abstraction worthy of abandonment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although it is precisely the Trinity’s classical formulation that receives the criticisms just noted, it is important to begin at the end, so to speak, by introducing the operative terms before analyzing the scriptural context<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out of which<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the historical context<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in which<!-- raw HTML omitted --> these trinitarian terms grew. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The definitive statement of trinitarian belief is the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 CE, discussed below.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> In brief, however, Christians confess belief in one God who eternally and only exists in one divine substance, essence, or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ousia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and in three divine subsistences, Persons, or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?</a>“)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity as just stated is that it nowhere appears within the pages of Scripture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian proof-texts in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if<!-- raw HTML omitted --> one abandons modernity’s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Instead, the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> narrative<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->These three<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dramatis personae Dei<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> persona<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->8<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, the Spirit appears as a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> persona<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The significance of trinitarian “proof-texts” mentioned above is that they portray the three persons of the divine drama in close proximity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most significant of these is the baptismal formula of Matthew 28:19, spoken by the Son himself: “…baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Although the earliest Christians used poignant trinitarian phrases before the full implications of such had been thoroughly considered, these biblical patterns provided “the raw data from which the more developed descriptions of the Christian doctrine of God [would] come.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neither was the doctrine formed in a historical vacuum. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instead, as Wainwright notes: “the classic creeds were being formulated at the same time as the canon of the Scriptures was being recognized and determined; there was interaction between the two processes, and the Scriptures and the creeds continue to function reciprocally.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->11<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ecumenical creeds – such as the Apostles’, Niceno-Constantinopolitan (381), and the Chalcedonian <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Definitio Fidei <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(451) – serve as an interpretive key to the complex Scriptures, and yet also distill the divine drama of the Bible into a concise summary.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->12<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A crucial facet of trinitarian doctrine in which this dialectic took place was the distinction between the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> immanent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> economic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Trinity – the former referring to the Trinity within itself, and the latter referring to the Trinity’s external relationship to the universe. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While the majority of Scripture provides portrayals of the economic Trinity interacting with creation, it also offers enticing glimpses into the immanent relationships between the persons of the divine drama.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->13<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The doctrine that developed from such glimpses offered a way of distinguishing between how God relates to himself and to everything else, but also concluded that “the immanent Trinity lives no other plot than that displayed in the economic Trinity, that when you are taken into the story told in Scripture, you are taken into God himself.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->14<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words, “there is no deeper reality of God lurking in the background” behind the three Persons of the Godhead.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->15<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although many of the disagreements took place before the distinction between the economic and immanent Trinity was formalized, the contours of the historical trinitarian debates revolve around where the conceptual boundary lies between the two.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->16<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A concern for the preservation of God’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unity <!-- raw HTML omitted -->motivated many of the early controversies. For example, Paul of Samosata collapsed the immanent Trinity to the Father alone, pushing the Son and Spirit into the economy, in their respective relations to the human being Jesus and the apostles – the view known as adoptionism.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->17<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Similarly, Sabellius pushed all three divine Persons into the economy, positing that the immanent Godhead was one God who exists in three modes or roles of being to the external creation – the view known as modalism.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->18<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, it was Arius’s commitment to monotheism that led him to shrink the immanent Trinity down to the Father alone – concluding that, because God is the indivisible cause of all that exists, he must have existed prior to the Son, who is “not everlasting or co-everlasting or unbegotten with the Father.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->19<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although each of these views would ultimately find condemnation in the creeds of the Church, it was Arius’s conception of a created Son that ignited the controversy that led to the Council of Nicaea (325), which refuted Arianism by declaring that the Son is “begotten, not made, being of one substance [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->homoousios<!-- raw HTML omitted -->] with the Father.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->20<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the trinitarian debates continued, in part because of the relative ambiguity of the term homoousios and the ability of different factions to interpret it as they wished.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->21<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The years between the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople (381) were theologically chaotic as Athanasius of Alexandria and the Cappadocian fathers (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa) fought for the Nicene view of the Trinity against its detractors, Arian and otherwise.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->22<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, along the lines of Arius’s original concerns, if the Son and the Spirit are granted full divinity along with the Father (as they are in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed), why do Christians confess one God and not three? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gregory of Nyssa addressed these concerns first by appealing to the differences between the trinitarian terms<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ousia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (common essence) and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostasis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (distinct personal subsistence). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Belonging to the category of collective or common nouns – which unite by referring to the common nature shared by diverse members of the same category –<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ousia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to the divine essence or substance, shared equally by the three<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Godhead so that they are properly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> homoousioi<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or of the same substance, with one another.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->23<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, belonging to the category of individual or proper nouns – which distinguish by referring to only one member of a particular category –<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostasis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to the individual identity or subsistence of each divine Person which demarcates it from the other two.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->24<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The divine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are distinguishable in that “the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are one in all things save in the being unbegotten [Father], the being begotten [Son], and the procession [Spirit].”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->25<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The distinction between a common <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ousia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and distinct <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, therefore, prevents the collapse of the Trinity, yet through a crucial difference between the distinction-in-unity with regard to humanity and with regard to the divine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After all, it is difficult to ascertain the unifying<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ousia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of humanity because the distinct<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted --> both appear and behave in such discordant ways. Due to their myriad differences and a merely conceptual unity, humans are not properly referred to as one human but many. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In contrast, the unity of the three divine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is actual, by virtue of the trinitarian rule<!-- raw HTML omitted --> opera trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->26<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> As Gregory of Nyssa notes, “every activity which pervades from God to creation and is named according to our manifold design starts off from the Father, proceeds through the Son, and is completed by the Holy Spirit.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->27<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christians worship one God, because although each divine Person is God, “by the same proclamation God is one, because neither in regard to nature [or ousia] nor activity is any difference viewed.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->28<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Unlike the diverse and discordant human<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hypostases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the divine persons are completely unified in their will and operations. Therefore, in the words of Gregory of Nazianzus: “the Godhead exists undivided in beings divided.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->29<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To return to what was mentioned at the outset, the best discussions of the Trinity also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> end<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with an acknowledgment of its inherent mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason’s highest reach. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theological modesty is always in order, in part because of the unavoidable limitations of finite human speech about<!-- raw HTML omitted --> anything<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, much less about the infinite God. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Granted, certain ways of framing how God can be one and yet three are better than others, not only based upon their coherence with the traditions of orthodoxy, but also with regard to their impact on other areas of theological concern – such as the atonement and interpersonal relationships.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->30<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yet, because true theology is not learning how to speak about God in order to master him intellectually, but in order to worship him faithfully, a persistent lacuna in trinitarian understanding is surely acceptable. For, although the gracious condescension of the triune God enables our faith to seek understanding successfully, the inscrutable mysteries of the same triune God ensure that some understandings will ever transcend our faith’s reach.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
