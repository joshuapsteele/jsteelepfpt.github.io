<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400introductionspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introduction<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The three or so decisions you make each day about what to eat are some of the most consequential choices you make in your life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Author Wendell Berry notes that, “eating is an agricultural act.” That is, eating is more than just the satisfaction of appetite. Our plates are food’s final destination in a long supply chain that runs <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This backstory is both daunting and empowering, because the food choices we make – what we eat, and who we buy it from – send economic signals through all corners of this supply chain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a part of a broken world, contemporary food production it is filled with injustice and often creates suffering. But, it does not have to be that way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bible clearly calls Christians to work towards a just future, to work with the grain of the gospel, as it were, by participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world. One of the most needed areas for this redemption is the modern food system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400factory-farmingspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Factory Farming<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most consumers assume that their meat comes from farms where animals graze and wander around green, pastoral landscapes. That could not be further from the truth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400animal-sufferingspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Animal Suffering<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://farmforward.com/ending-factory-farming/#easy-footnote-3"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->vast majority<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(&gt;99%) of the more than 10 billion chickens, turkeys, pigs, and cows slaughtered each year in the US for meat are raised on factory farms, industrial facilities often referred to as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Built to maximize efficiency and profits, these farms are hell on earth for their inhabitants. Animals are <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cafo+pictures&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGqOXlv6DYAhUL5oMKHUF2AogQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=835"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->overcrowded<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and prevented from moving freely or performing natural behaviors. Many never see sunlight or grass at any point in their lives, and are fed unnatural diets of subsidized feed crops such as corn and soybeans — enduring <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.mercyforanimals.org/the-problem"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->miserable<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lives that are cut short by slaughter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To ensure that they reach slaughter weight quickly, chickens have been bred to feel constant hunger and eat constantly. Breeds that used to take 6 months to reach full size now regularly attain that weight in one month. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To put that growth in perspective, imagine a human baby reaching full physical maturity at<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->age 3, instead of taking 18 years. As a consequence of this rapid growth, many chickens have an insufficient skeletal structure and are frequently crippled by bones that break under the stress of their unnaturally large weight.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of this cruelty would be illegal if done to companion animals like dogs or horses, but it is regularly inflicted on billions of animals who have similar levels of intelligence and emotional complexity without a second thought. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals experience a wide range of emotions, including curiosity, pleasure, pain, fear, joy, anger, sadness, playfulness and more. They most certainly have the capacity to suffer, and suffer they do, innumerable animals in unimaginable conditions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400environmental-costsspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Environmental Costs<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition, animal agriculture comes with a hefty environmental price tag. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meat production is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/studies-link-red-meat-and-climate-change-20264"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->resource-intensive<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Producing one pound of feedlot beef takes an average of 2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and one gallon of gasoline. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.fao.org/animal-production/en/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->found that almost 80%<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of the planet’s total agricultural land is used for feeding or processing meat. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Globally, animal agriculture <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->emits more greenhouse gases<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->than the entire transportation system – all cars, trains, planes and ships – and is responsible for more emissions than any other economic sector.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-grain-of-the-gospel-eden-shalom-and-the-world-to-comespan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Grain of the Gospel: Eden, Shalom, and the World to Come<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The current food system bears all the markings of a broken system, and is surely not what Christians should envision for a redeemed world. The gospel message is that creation was made good, it belongs to God, it is in a broken state, but God is at work redeeming the world and bringing about its complete reconciliation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-created-worldspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Created World<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the original created order of Eden, all creatures lived peacefully in community, and God told humans to consume only plant-based foods:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Animals were not created to be food for humans or for each other, but to be companions:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this context, the God-given “dominion” over animals implies a parent-child relationship, not a hunter-hunted dynamic. As <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.petalambs.com/scripture-and-testimonies/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->this piece from PETA LAMBS<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->puts it:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“God created humans in God’s image and according to God’s likeness and told humans to steward this new creation. And what is God’s likeness? Throughout the Scripture, God shows us mercy that we do not deserve, grace that we have not earned, and love that we cannot imagine. We are made in that likeness and are charged with reflecting those qualities to the whole of creation. Being made in the image of God is a call to caretaking, compassion, and mercy.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eden was a herbivorous world, filled with animals that were created to be companions with humans. Eating meat begins after human pride and greed allow brokenness into the world.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-fallen-worldspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Fallen World<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the new human-created order, Creation has been marred, good things have been repurposed for evil, blood is being shed, and instead of living in a peaceful community of God’s original design, humans are now violent toward animals and each other.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We can choose to live either <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->with<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->against<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the grain of the gospel. Every time we eat meat, we necessarily participate in this fallen order and comply with the imperfections of this world. But, when we avoid killing other creatures, our efforts are directed away from brokenness and towards reversing the curse. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While the Fall is a part of our present reality, Christians are called to work towards reversing its effects, not accentuating them. The Fall is the way the world is, but Eden and Heaven are the way it should be, and it seems good for Christians to participate in building the fully redeemed world to come rather than deepening the effects of the Fall.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-future-worldspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Future World<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prophecies such as Isaiah 11.6–9 seem to foresee a return to this vegetarian world: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The redeemed world to come, the kingdom that God is building on earth, is an herbivorous kingdom, free from death and suffering. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="is-this-a-valid-theological-argument">Is this a valid theological argument?</h2>
<p><strong>It is important to note that Christians should not always operate on the basis of the world to come in the midst of the world as it is.</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There will not be marriage in the world to come (Matt. 22.30), nor will people teach each other about God (Jer. 31:34), but these are both acceptable things to do in the present age. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Why should eating meat be any different?</strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With their roots going back beyond the Fall to God’s good creation, marriage and teaching about God are good things to do in the present, but will become unnecessary in the world to come. Eating meat, on the other hand, cannot be traced back beyond the Fall. It is an unneeded, negative act in the present and will be impossible in a fully redeemed world. We do not have the license to act violently in the present world just because the future perfect world is not yet fully realized.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we eat meat-free diets, we are participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world, actualizing a future where humans and animals will live in community as nonviolent companions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.thebanner.org/features/2018/02/eating-toward-shalom-why-food-ethics-matters-for-the-21st-century-church"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matthew C. Halteman summarizes it well<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Caring for animals was the very first responsibility bestowed to humankind by God—our very first chance to practice the capacities of love, power, and mercy that accompany the divine image within us…Someone seeking to eat mindfully aspires to live toward the biblical ideal of shalom—the peaceful state of holistic flourishing that is portrayed first in Eden and last on the holy mountain of the prophet Isaiah’s vision of a fully redeemed world.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400conclusionspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reducing meat consumption has many benefits:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eating is an agricultural, economic, and spiritual act.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because we can eat either <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->with <!-- raw HTML omitted --></em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->or <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->against <!-- raw HTML omitted --></em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the grain of the gospel, Christians need to see ethical food choices as everyday acts of virtue. Christians need to become food theologians, acquiring a moral imagination that sees animals as valuable co-heirs of the present and future world, and finding ways to look beyond the habits and comforts of our current food system to participate in a better, redeemed alternative.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="want-to-learn-more">Want to learn more?</h2>
