<p>The Gospel is more than a checklist, more than a five-minute “yes-or-no” conversation in which you can make a new Christian… its a narrative of cosmic significance. If God really is reconciling <strong><em>all things</em></strong> to himself in and through Jesus Christ, then everything we do and say, ESPECIALLY when we’re speaking of the Gospel, must change. </p>
