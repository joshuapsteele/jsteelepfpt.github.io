<ul>
<li>Notes 1 Cor. 6:9–10 and Rom. 14:5–6 as scriptural support for every generation’s need “to decide just what beliefs and behavior are morally mandated of all believers, and what beliefs and behavior may be left to the individual believer’s conscience” (383).</li>
<li>“The matters where Christians may safely agree to disagree have traditionally been labeled <em>adiaphora</em>, ‘indifferent things’” (383). Yet, because <em>adiaphora</em> are not unimportant, Carson prefers “disputable matters” to “indifferent matters.”</li>
<li>Some decisions, like the resurrection of Jesus Christ being essential, are easy. Other decisions are more complicated. Carson notes “that some things that were thought theologically indisputable in the past have become disputable” (383). Culture and history can/do play a role.</li>
<li>Carson notes the contemporary debate over homosexuality as an example of the <em>adiaphora</em> question’s relevance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="he-provides-ten-reflections-on-what-does-and-does-not-constitute-a-theologically-disputable-matter-384">He provides “ten reflections on what does and does not constitute a theologically disputable matter” (384).</h3>
<ol>
<li>“That something is disputed does not make it theologically disputable, i.e., part of the <em>adiaphora</em>.” (384).</li>
<li>“What places something in the indisputable column, then, is not whether or not it is disputed by some people, or has ever been disputed, but what the Scriptures consistently say about the topic, and how the Scriptures tie it to other matters. At the end of the day that turns on sober, even-handed, reverent exegesis—as Athanasius understood in his day on a different topic.” (384).</li>
<li>“My third, fourth, and fifth observations about disputable matters arise from a close reading of 1 Corinthians 8:1-11:1. In 1 Corinthians 8, Paul does not assert that Christians should not eat meat that has been offered to idols. . . . Nevertheless, Christians with a “weak” conscience . . . must <em>not</em> eat such meat, lest they do damage to their conscience. Eating the meat that has been offered to idols is not intrinsically wrong, but violating one’s own conscience is wrong.” (385).</li>
<li>“an action belonging in the disputable column is not necessarily one that Christians are free to take up. Rather, Christians may rule the action out of bounds either because they admit they have weak consciences, or, knowing their consciences are strong, because they voluntarily put the action aside out of love for weaker believers.” (385).</li>
<li>“actions that may belong to the <em>adiaphora</em>, i.e., that are rightly judged disputable, may in certain cultural contexts become absolutely condemned, thus now belonging in the indisputable column. More briefly: in the right context, what belongs in the disputable column gets shifted to the indisputably bad column.” (386). Illustrates this with the odd apparent contrast between what Paul has to say in 1 Cor. 8 and 1 Cor. 10:14–22.</li>
<li>“Sometimes the theological associations of an action, in a particular context, establish whether an action is right or wrong. In one context, it may be absolutely right or wrong, and thus belong in the indisputable column; in another context, the action may belong to the <em>adiaphora</em>.” (386). Illustrates this with Titus (Gal. 2:1-5) and Timothy (Acts 16:3) re: circumcision.</li>
<li>“Under the new covenant, there is a deep suspicion of those who, for the sake of greater spirituality or deeper purity, elevate celibacy or who prohibit certain foods or who inject merely human (i.e., biblically unwarranted) commands, or who scrap over minor points (e.g., Mark 7:19; 1 Tim 4:3-4; 1:6; 2 Tim 2:14, 16-17; Tit 1:10-16; cf. Rom 14). Such people try to elevate matters that should never be placed in the indisputable column to a high place in the hierarchy of virtues.” (387).</li>
<li>Has moral law been relativized into the disputable column? Carson notes that some make argument from Rom. 14:5–6 relativizing observance of days → Sabbath → Decalogue → moral law. Carson admits that the issues are complicated here, but he provides a few ways of salvaging Sabbath, Decalogue, and moral law from Rom. 14:5–6. He also thinks that homosexuality is different, since “in the Bible there is no text whatsoever that hints that homosexual marriage might in some cases be acceptable.” (387).</li>
<li>Re: William Webb’s <em>Slaves, Women, and Homosexuals</em> and the redemptive movement hermeneutic, Carson points out that Webb himself clarifies why it doesn’t apply to homosexuality. But Carson agrees with Grudem’s critique of Webb. We must follow the trajectories <em>within</em> the Scriptures, “but that does not justify treating the trajectories <em>beyond</em> the Scriptures as normative, the more so when such trajectories undermine what the Scriptures actually say” (388).</li>
<li>Instead of asking questions in the sense of “What are we allowed to do? What can we get away with?,” we should be asking “What will bring glory to God?” (388).</li>

<ul>
<li>The chapter is titled “Theology’s Tasks &amp; Traditions.” The section is titled “Theology’s Critical Task.”</li>
<li>“Theology’s critical task is to examine beliefs and teachings about God, ourselves and the world in light of Christian sources, especially the primary norm of the biblical message” (70).</li>
<li>After a belief is determined to be valid, then we categorize it based upon relative importance.</li>
<li>“Over the centuries theologians have developed three main categories of Christian beliefs: <em>dogma</em>, <em>doctrine</em>, and <em>opinion</em>.
<ul>
<li>“A belief is considered a <strong>dogma</strong> if it seems essential to the gospel. In other words, if its denial would seem to entail <em>apostasy</em>—rejection of the gospel of Jesus Christ—then it is a dogma.</li>
<li>“A <strong>doctrine</strong>, as the term is used here, is a belief that is considered important without being essential. That is, a particular Christian church or denomination may consider the belief a test of fellowship without claiming that its denial amounts to apostasy. The denial of a doctrine may be considered heresy but not necessarily outright apostasy.</li>
<li>“A belief is relegated to the status of <strong>opinion</strong> when it is considered interesting but relatively unimportant to the faith of the church. One is allowed to believe whatever one wishes about the matter so long as it does not conflict with a dogma or doctrine. Denial of an opinion is simply a difference of interpretation.” (73).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grenz and Olson acknowledge that “there is no universal categorization” (74). This is “one major reason for the existence of different denominations” (73).</li>
<li>Dogma was the first category to develop in the history of the church, mainly around the ecumenical creeds and the deliberations behind them.</li>
<li>Doctrines have to do with particular traditions/denominations and criteria for membership.</li>
<li>Opinions are judged to be matters of private interpretation.</li>
<li>“One of the major activities of theologians, then, is to discover the proper location in this schema for each valid Christian belief. (Of course, if a belief is criticized as invalid or false, it is left out of the schema entirely)” (76.)</li>
<li>Some churches push everything toward the category of opinion, evacuating dogma and doctrine. Others push everything into dogma, evacuating doctrine and opinion.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bookofconcord.org/fc-ep.php#X.%20Church%20Rites">Article 10 of the Formula of Concord</a> is devoted to the controversy “Concerning ceremonies or church rites which are neither commanded nor forbidden in God’s Word, but have been introduced into the Church for the sake of good order and propriety.”</li>
<li>The main question/debate was “whether, in time of persecution and in case of confession, even if the enemies of the Gospel have not reached an agreement with us in doctrine, some abrogated ceremonies, which in themselves are matters of indifference and are neither commanded nor forbidden by God, may nevertheless, upon the pressure and demand of the adversaries, be reestablished without violence to conscience, and we may thus [rightly] have conformity with them in such ceremonies and adiaphora. To this the one side has said Yea, the other, Nay.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="affirmative-statements-from-the-epitomesummary">Affirmative Statements (from the Epitome/Summary)</h3>
<ol>
<li>“the ceremonies or church rites which are neither commanded nor forbidden in God’s Word, but have been instituted alone for the sake of propriety and good order, are in and of themselves no divine worship, nor even a part of it.  <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt.%2015.9">Matt. 15:9</a> :In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”</li>
<li>“the congregation of God of every place and every time has the power, according to its circumstances, to change such ceremonies in such manner as may be most useful and edifying to the congregation of God.”</li>
<li>“all frivolity and offense should be avoided, and special care should be taken to exercise forbearance towards the weak in faith.  <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor.%208.9">1 Cor. 8:9</a> ;  <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom.%2014.13">Rom. 14:13</a> .”</li>
<li>“in time of persecution, when a plain [and steadfast] confession is required of us, we should not yield to the enemies in regard to such adiaphora, . . . For in such a case it is no longer a question concerning adiaphora, but concerning the truth of the Gospel, concerning [preserving] Christian liberty, and concerning sanctioning open idolatry, as also concerning the prevention of offense to the weak in the faith [how care should be taken lest idolatry be openly sanctioned and the weak in faith be offended]; in which we have nothing to concede, but should plainly confess and suffer on that account what God sends, and what He allows the enemies of His Word to inflict upon us.”</li>
<li>“no Church should condemn another because one has less or more external ceremonies not commanded by God than the other, if otherwise there is agreement among them in doctrine and all its articles, as also in the right use of the holy Sacraments, according to the well-known saying: Dissonantia ieiunii non dissolvit consonantiam fidei, Disagreement in fasting does not destroy agreement in faith.”</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-statements-from-the-epitomesummary">Negative Statements (from the Epitome/Summary):</h3>
<p>“Accordingly, we reject and condemn as wrong and contrary to God’s Word when it is taught:</p>
<ol>
<li>“That human ordinances and institutions in the church should be regarded as in themselves a divine worship or part of it.</li>
<li>“When such ceremonies, ordinances, and institutions are violently forced upon the congregation of God as necessary, contrary to its Christian liberty which it has in external things.</li>
<li>“Also, that in time of persecution and public confession [when a clear confession is required] we may yield to the enemies of the Gospel in such adiaphora and ceremonies, or may come to an agreement with them (which causes injury to the truth).</li>
<li>“Also, when these external ceremonies and adiaphora are abrogated in such a manner as though it were not free to the congregation of God to employ one or more [this or that] in Christian liberty, according to its circumstances, as may be most useful at any time to the Church [for edification].”</li>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://mwerickson.com/">Matt Erickson</a> for <a href="https://micro.blog/mwerickson/7210452">drawing my attention</a> back to this 2017 blog exchange. It all started with James K.A. Smith wondering if it’s a mistake to use “(un)orthodox” language to describe contemporary debates about sexuality and marriage. Instead, Smith thinks/thought we should reserve “orthodoxy” language to refer to what’s explicitly stated in the ecumenical creeds.</p>

Treier, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RP9Asg">Theology and the Mirror of Scripture: A Mere Evangelical Account</a></em> (IVP Academic, 2015), 45–53, 122–27, 196–220.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note that Vanhoozer and Treier are attempting to articular “mere evangelical theology.”</li>
<li>They propose the model of an “anchored set,” in which the anchor is the being of the Triune God (52).</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Here’s how they frame things a bit later in the book.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Apostolicity: the magisterial authority of canonical judgments. To determine essentials here, Vanhoozer and Treier propose asking “what would preserve the integrity of the story of salvation” (124).</li>
<li>Catholicity: the ministerial authority of the scope of the Spirit’s illumination.
<ul>
<li>First-level doctrine:
<ul>
<li>“one that identifies the persons of the triune God on whom the gospel’s integrity depends”</li>
<li>“one in which the communion of the saints has already formed a consensus”</li>
<li>“the agreed universal judgments of the church: what Christians at all times and places must confess in order to preserve the gospel’s intelligibility (the material principle) and partake of the fellowship of the saints (the formal principle).</li>
<li>Dogmas: “teachings for which the Spirit has seen fit to illuminate the whole church. To deny a dogma is tantamount to apostasy or heresy.” (125)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level-two doctrines:
<ul>
<li>“treat events (e.g., atonement, resurrection) and aspects of salvation history (e.g., image of God, sin, justification) that must be affirmed, though there is some scope for different interpretations”</li>
<li>“lack full catholicity: they are the doctrines on which evangelicals who affirm <em>sola Scriptura</em> have not reached agreement”</li>
<li>“often represent points of significant ‘regional’ difference—points important enough to require for membership and shared ministry within a church or denomination, yet without impeding all translocal cooperation between evangelicals” (125–26).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level-three doctrines:
<ul>
<li>“allow for considerable freedom of opinion without fostering congregational division. For differences over them are not damaging to the gospel or debilitating for shared mission”</li>
<li>“That Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead is first order, the nature of the millennium is second order and the exact sequence of events pertaining to the millennium is probably third order” (126).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wisdom: Increasing in (apostolic) word and (catholic) Spirit. (126–27).</li>
</ul>
<p>Later in the book, Vanhoozer and Treier flesh-out this first-, second-, and third-order doctrinal framework with biblical engagement (196–207).</p>
<ul>
<li>“Gospel versus heresy: Discerning dialogue” (summary of the gospel in 1 Cor. 15; pp. 198–201)</li>
<li>“Ministry and ministry: Maintaining fellowship” (conflict between Paul and Barnabas in Acts 15:36–41; pp. 202–204)</li>
<li>“The same mind: Pursuing collaboration” (Paul’s instructions in Romans 14–15; pp. 204–7)</li>
</ul>
