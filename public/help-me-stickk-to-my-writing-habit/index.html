<p>To do so, I need to write regularly. For me, that means writing every day—a minimum of 500 words every day.</p>
<p>Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I’ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it’s been a bear to get back on!</p>
<p>So, I’ve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.</p>
<p>If I don’t write 500 words related to my dissertation every day, StickK will donate $35 dollars every week I fail to the NRA.</p>
<p><em>(I do not like the NRA.)</em></p>
<p>I’m giving this a try for 8 weeks. If it works well, I’ll continue the commitment via StickK!</p>
<p>If you’d like to support me and keep track of my progress on StickK, you can do so by clicking <a href="https://stik.to/r2N">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a habit you’d like to stick to, give StickK a try!</p>
