<li>What’s causing you frustration, angst, or stress these days?</li>

<li>What obstacles are in the way of you achieving your goals?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s MY problem/frustration: <strong>I don’t know what problems are causing YOU the most friction!</strong></p>
<p>I don’t feel like wasting my time researching and writing about things that only <em>I</em> care about.</p>
<p>So, help me help you: Leave me a comment below and tell me what’s frustrating you.</p>
<p>Think it’s too random? Unrelated to what I’d be interested in? Try me.</p>
<p>If I can’t help you solve your problem/frustration, I can help you find someone who can.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Rant at me in the comments!</p>
<p>(Or, if it’s a more private matter, send me an email. Put “joshua,” then the @ symbol, then joshuapsteele.com and voila! You’ve got my email address.)</p>
