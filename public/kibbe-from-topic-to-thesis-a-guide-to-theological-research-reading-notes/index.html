<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Process: From “Topic to Thesis”</li>
<li>The Ongoing Conversation</li>
<li>Theological Research is like Any Other Kind of Research</li>
<li>Theological Research is <em>Not</em> like Any Other Kind of Research</li>
<li>Defining Key Terms:
<ul>
<li><strong>Theological</strong>: Referring broadly to both biblical and theological studies</li>
<li><strong>Primary</strong> Sources:
<ul>
<li>Different senses:
<ul>
<li>The single object of your research.</li>
<li>Sources contemporary with your subject matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Helpful questions: Is a particular primary source…
<ul>
<li>Relevant?</li>
<li>Necessary?</li>
<li>Necessary for <em>your</em> research, given the scope, time constraints, etc.?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Secondary</strong> Sources: Points back to the object of your research.
<ul>
<li>Guide your interaction with the primary sources.</li>
<li>Bring you into the conversation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tertiary</strong> Sources: Written about secondary sources.
<ul>
<li>Diagnostic Question: Is this source making an argument about an issue (secondary)? Or explaining what others have argued (tertiary)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Research Bibliography</strong>: Keep a running list of relevant sources throughout your project, then cut it down to the sources you’ve interacted with.</li>
<li><strong>Scholarly Sources</strong>: Peer reviewed; interact with other sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Theological Research: The Method
<ul>
<li>Finding Direction</li>
<li>Gathering Sources</li>
<li>Understanding Issues</li>
<li>Entering Discussion</li>
<li>Establishing Position</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-direction">Finding Direction</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keys to Finding Direction
<ul>
<li>Do not decide what your paper will argue before starting the research process!</li>
<li>Research takes time.</li>
<li>Don’t touch secondary sources in the initial phase of your research.</li>
<li>This is the only phase in which you will depend heavily on tertiary sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to Ask TERTIARY Sources
<ul>
<li>What are the relevant and necessary primary sources?</li>
<li>Who are the key people?</li>
<li>What are the key works?</li>
<li>What are the key issues?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to Ask PRIMARY Sources
<ul>
<li>Which portions are clearly relevant to the topic you’ve chosen?</li>
<li>What issues in those portions strike you as particularly interesting?</li>
<li>What are some <em>possible</em> arguments you could make?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gathering-sources">Gathering Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keys to Gathering Sources
<ul>
<li>Do not spend too much time on any one source.</li>
<li>There’s a fine line between redirecting and getting distracted.</li>
<li>Not every important source will be well written.</li>
<li>Research is first and foremost about primary sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to Ask SECONDARY Sources
<ul>
<li>Does this source handle your primary source(s)?</li>
<li>Is it a scholarly source?</li>
<li>Does it deal with one or more of the issues you’ve identified from the primary source as a possible topic? Does it highlight and issue that you’ve missed that could serve as a possible topic?</li>
<li>Does it point you toward more secondary sources that might be useful? If so, put them in your research bibliography. Be aware of chronological development between sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excursus One: Common Research Mistakes with Sources
<ul>
<li>Using non scholarly sources.</li>
<li>Citing the internet.</li>
<li>Using only sources that you agree with.</li>
<li>Using only one type of source. (Commentaries, journal articles, dissertations, essays, monographs, and dictionary articles are all important!)</li>
<li>Considering only one sub discipline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-issues">Understanding Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keys to Understanding Issues
<ul>
<li>Read with a pen or pencil.</li>
<li>Allow yourself large chunks of time to read.</li>
<li>Read sources not for their own sake, but for the sake of your paper.</li>
<li>The specificity of your sources will determine the specificity of your topic.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to cycle back and forth between gathering sources and understanding issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to Ask SECONDARY Sources
<ul>
<li>Where is the discussion coming from? What have been the major positions and the major shifts?</li>
<li>Where is the discussion going <em>today</em>?</li>
<li>What sorts of arguments are being made? What are the strengths and weaknesses of those arguments? Who stands on which side of the divide?</li>
<li>What might be a possible thesis, and what are the arguments for and against it? What evidence from the <em>primary source</em> is relevant for this thesis?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excursus Two: Common Research Mistakes in Interaction
<ul>
<li>Too much quoting.</li>
<li>Depending too much on tertiary and secondary sources.</li>
<li>Misunderstanding sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entering-discussion">Entering Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keys to Entering the Discussion
<ul>
<li>Do you have something to contribute to the discussion?</li>
<li>Can you recognize the appropriate time to enter the discussion?
<ul>
<li>Are your sources conversing with each other?</li>
<li>Can you converse with the sources?</li>
<li>Could you sit down at a table with the 4-5 most significant scholars in this area and understand and contribute to the discussion?</li>
<li>When’s your deadline? (Recommends that you stop looking for new sources at least a week prior to final deadline.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you articulate how your thesis fits into the discussion?
<ul>
<li>What is the specific issue?</li>
<li>What is the current conversation about that issue?</li>
<li>What is my argument concerning the specific issue?</li>
<li>How does my argument fit into the current conversation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to Ask SECONDARY Sources
<ul>
<li>What arguments are scholars making <em>for</em> and <em>against</em> my thesis?</li>
<li>Does my thesis hold up against the counterarguments? (Include objections and your responses to these objections.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to Ask PRIMARY Sources
<ul>
<li>What evidence has been lost in the shuffle? Are there any issues in the primary source that no one seems to be talking about? (Note: if your list of these points is very long, you’ve probably not done enough reading yet!)</li>
<li>Does my argument match what the primary source has to say? (Does it work with the entire primary source and not just one tiny part of it?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establishing-position">Establishing Position</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keys to Establishing Position
<ul>
<li>Your thesis is the heart and soul of your paper.</li>
<li>Don’t start writing the paper too soon.</li>
<li>Research is entering into an already-existing conversation about your topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appendix-a-ten-things-you-should-_never_-do-in-a-theological-research-paper">Appendix A: Ten Things You Should <em>Never</em> Do in a Theological Research Paper</h2>
<ol>
<li>Suggest that your research paper has broken new ground.</li>
<li>Use debated terms without demonstrating that you know they’re debated terms.</li>
<li>Make personal attacks on scholars you disagree with.</li>
<li>Discuss how you “feel” about certain issues or viewpoints.</li>
<li>Commit logical fallacies.</li>
<li>Misrepresent scholarly viewpoints or arguments.</li>
<li>Adjectivize the scholars you disagree [and agree] with. (“Compelling”…”liberal”…”robust”…”reductionistic.” These aren’t arguments!)</li>
<li>Forget to identify your thesis.</li>
<li>Ignore the required citation style guide.</li>
<li>Plagiarize.</li>
