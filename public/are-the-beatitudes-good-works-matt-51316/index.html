I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does <em>not</em> take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>After all, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, complicating things just a bit, in his discussion of the “salt and light” passage in Matthew 5:13–16, Bonhoeffer seems to equate the Beatitudes with “good works”!</p>
<p>Here are the verses in question:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Toward the end of his discussion of these verses, Bonhoeffer relates Christ’s cross to the visibility and “good works” of the disciples.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note the connection with the Beatitudes. Bonhoeffer continues:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>R.T. France agrees, noting the connection between these “good deeds” and the Beatitudes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ll admit that I’m used to taking Matthew 5:13–16 in a more mundane and less eschatological sense than Bonhoeffer. I’ve interpreted Jesus’ words as more along the lines of “mind your reputation in the eyes of outsiders” than “demonstrate good deeds that, because they are at cross-purposes with the world, won’t even be recognized as such other than eschatologically.”</p>
<p>After all, <em>when</em> will the outsiders glorify God? Now? Or, as it were, at the end of days? Here’s what 1 Peter 2:11–12 says:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Perhaps Bonhoeffer, France, and Barth are all right to draw our attention back to the eschatological character of the Sermon on the Mount. Yet, I have to agree with France when he explains “the eschatological character of the promises” in the Beatitudes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even just the mixture of verbal tenses in the Beatitudes reminds me of <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/when-will-thy-kingdom-come-the-timing-and-agency-of-the-kingdom-of-god-in-the-lords-prayer/">the complex interplay between the “already” and the “not yet” when it comes to the Lord’s Prayer</a>.</p>
