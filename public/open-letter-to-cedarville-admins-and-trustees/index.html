<p>Allow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution. I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that <a href="http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/" title="My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience">I share your passion</a>. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife. Even more importantly, at Cedarville I have fallen in love with the Gospel. Thanks to godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch – my eyes have been opened to the richness, complexity, and scope of God’s redemptive mission.</p>
<p>I therefore raise the following concerns not as one who wants to malign Cedarville, disregard your wisdom, or perpetrate verbal violence. I raise them because I want Cedarville to contribute to God’s Kingdom to the fullest extent possible. I have invested four years of my life here as a CU Scholar, Getting Started Leader, Discipleship Leader, Student Grader, and Resident Assistant. I want future students, perhaps my own children someday, to be able to do the same. I want this University to thrive, inspiring true greatness for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That is why certain events within the Cedarville community this past year have caused me such great <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">concern</a>. I say this as respectfully as possible: some of your decisions and actions seem to contradict the most precious lessons that I have learned at your institution about the Gospel.</p>
<p>Among other troubling things, including the harassment of those <em>“godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch,”</em> I have observed <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/">the following:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>your approval of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/white-papers/">the White Papers</a> on <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Omniscience-White-Paper.pdf">omniscience</a>, <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Forensic-Justification.pdf">justification</a>, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Creation-White-Paper.pdf">creation</a>,</li>
<li>your rejection of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/theology-major-rejected/">the proposed Theology Major</a>,</li>
<li>your dismissal of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/dr-michael-pahl-dismissed/">Dr. Michael Pahl</a>,</li>
<li>the untimely resignation of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/dr-browns-resignation/">Dr. William Brown</a>,</li>
<li>the extremely untimely resignation of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/ruby-resigns/">Dr. Carl Ruby</a>,</li>
<li>your imminent cancellation of the <a href="http://ourcuprotest.wordpress.com/">Philosophy Major</a>,</li>
<li>and subsequent imminent release of either Dr. Shawn Graves or Dr. David Mills.</li>
</ul>
<p>As your younger brother in Christ, I am obligated to approach you <strong><em>peacefully</em></strong>. However, given the circumstances, it seems I am also obligated to approach you <strong><em>prophetically</em></strong>. Because of the biblical concept of **<em>shalom</em>_ _**as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->true peace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I believe I can do both at the same time. For _true peace _is not the absence of conflict or strong words, but the longing of the prophets for the time and place where the image-bearers of Yahweh will be reconciled to one another, to all of creation, and to God himself. It is the relational fullness and completeness of God’s justice-based, truth-filled, and transparent Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, then, I cry out for <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->justice<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, I cry out for <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->truth<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, I cry out for <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparency<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>For brevity’s sake, I’d like to distill my myriad concerns and frustrations into just two questions. After all, I’m just an undergraduate, and you do not owe me a thorough explanation of all the managerial minutiae behind your every move. However, you do owe me – along with current/future faculty, staff, students, and constituency – a thorough and impeccably honest explanation of <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cedarville University’s Identity and Vision<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In the interests of shalom, justice, truth, and transparency, I cry out for answer to the following two questions:</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All of your actions and decisions mentioned above, from the harassment of my mentors and friends to the proposed cancellation of the Philosophy Major, point towards Cedarville University being and becoming a **fundamentalist **(_euphemistically, a “conservative evangelical”) _<strong>institution</strong> – silencing honest dialogue, erecting thick walls between “us” and “them,” and carving out our own niche instead of engaging the unified diversity of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>After all, Dr. Ruby and Dr. Brown were two of Cedarville’s most prominent voices calling for **a robust evangelicalism, for this self-proclaimed liberal arts university to embrace and embody both cultural and ideological diversity – in the hopes of becoming one of the most influential Christ-centered learning communities in the twenty-first century. **</p>
<p>I and many others came to Cedarville University to study, work, and teach because we find this vision extremely compelling. We find things like poorly-written White Papers, inadequately explained rejections/cancellations of valuable majors, and questionable, sudden changes in beloved personnel much less compelling.</p>
<p>I will give you the benefit of the doubt and not discuss at-length the **<em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->many<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em> **rumors and reports of shameful things like <em>ad hoc</em> and biased “review” panels, bullying, power plays, and gag orders. If the rumors be true, then perhaps someone much higher than I should call for your repentance, if not your resignations. Such is the high responsibility of having “<em>For the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ</em>” as your institutional motto.</p>
<p>However, I will ask you for one important thing: <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->your honesty about where you want to take Cedarville University<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></p>
<p>Here’s why: as the Administration and Board of Trustees, you have a certain right to decide whether or not Cedarville will be robustly evangelical or fundamentalist. We might strongly disagree about which of those two options is preferable, but at the end of the day you make that decision, not I.</p>
<p>However, you have no right to <strong>obfuscate</strong> or <strong>vacillate</strong> on these important matters of identity and vision. While I can’t tell you what direction to take this University, I can boldly ask that <strong><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->you decide and then very clearly and publicly announce your decision<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em>.</strong></p>
<p>Even if I and many others disagree with your decision, we will respect you much more for your clarity. Trying to accomplish your goals behind the scenes has only resulted in confusion, damage, and pain to several individuals and families within the Cedarville community. In the wake of Dr. Pahl’s dismissal and the questionable resignations of Dr. Brown and Dr. Ruby, we need a clear statement, not a polished and vague press release. If you don’t plainly declare your position and objectives, then we will be forced to assume the worst regarding your motives.</p>
<p>After all, if achieving your goals involves getting rid of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Michael Pahl</em></strong>, an outstanding biblical theologian of whom you were willing to say: “[his] orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility.  He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.”</li>
<li><strong><em>William Brown</em></strong>, the president and beloved face of Cedarville University for thousands of students.</li>
<li>and <strong><em>Carl Ruby</em></strong>, a man whose respect and admiration from students, faculty, and staff transcend cultural, theological, and political dispositions…a preeminent model of Christ-like service, love, patience, respect, grace, and wisdom…and a pioneer for open and honest dialogue for the sake of God’s Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>…then your goals are probably in need of <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->revision<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>, but they are most certainly in need of <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->immediate clarification<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<p>For the sake of our Messiah, Savior, Lord, and King whose crown our University bears on its seal, I appeal to you as your younger brother in the faith: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->publicly declare your vision for the future of Cedarville University<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In the face of the growing angst, confusion, and frustration among students, alumni, faculty, staff, and constituency, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->explicitly state who you do and do not want working, teaching, and therefore studying at the University.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is my prayer that, as a result of your honesty and transparency, Cedarville University might become a more peaceful and just community in the midst of God’s shalom-filled Kingdom.</p>
<p>For King and Kingdom,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>
