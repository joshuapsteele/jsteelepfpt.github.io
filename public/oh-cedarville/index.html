<p>That’s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/">I love this place.</a> And that’s why I can’t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God’s Kingdom. And that’s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/" title="Open Letter to Cedarville Admins and Trustees">I’ve written about this before</a> (Open Letter).</p>
<p>The sources of my angst? I’ll give you the top three from my growing list of concerns.</p>
<h2 id="the-white-papersimg-decodingasync-classalignright-alt-srchttpwwwcallcentrehelpercomimagesstories2010white_papersgif-">The White Papers<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>I found out about these a year ago, when I had no idea of the storm that was brewing. I won’t spend time repeating what’s already been well said about the Papers <a href="http://theventriloquist.us/article/whats_wrong_with_white_papers">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mulberrycommunity.com/2012/10/is-that-so-cedarville.html">here</a>, but suffice it to say that if I turned in a White Paper as an undergraduate theological essay, I’d be getting a C- and a talk from my professor for my sub-par work. It’s patently obvious that Bib/Theo scholars were NOT consulted in the composition of these documents. Or, if they were, they were summarily ignored. And CU is making PhDs in Bib/Theo studies sign these things! Despicable.</p>
<p>This seems like a shameful attempt of reigning in the “creeping liberalism” of Cedarville’s Bible department. First, if you know any of the conservative evangelical CU Bible faculty, you’ll realize that this is some sort of sick joke. Second, at least proofread your documents to the standards of good scholarship! Even if I agreed with the White Papers’ attempts to silence debate and discussion on matters related to creation, justification, and omniscience, I would still be ashamed of their poor quality.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read Cedarville’s White Papers, they can <em>finally</em> be found <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">here</a> (to the right), on the University website. We had to petition and then wait <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->a couple months<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> before the Administration publicly posted the White Papers, even though they are supposed to describe the University’s <em><strong>official position</strong></em> on three important areas of doctrine!!! Did Cedarville ever intend on releasing these documents if students hadn’t petitioned Dr. Gredy and Dr. Cornman? Or were the White Papers just supposed to be a secret weapon to cleanse the Bible faculty? Apparently they were important enough to be used in the firing of Dr. Michael Pahl.</p>
<h2 id="michael-pahlimg-decodingasync-classalignright-alt-srchttpwwwcedarvilleedumediaimagescampus-newsnews2011michael-pahljpg-">Michael Pahl<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Dr. Pahl was hired before the 2011-12 school year. He moved his family (wife and four children) all the way from Canada to Cedarville, OH, persuaded that he was going to be a good fit for the Bible department at Cedarville University. After all, the CU hiring process is lengthy and it’s a very long way to move one’s family. After teaching for just two semesters, and closing on a 100 year-old farmhouse in town, he was fired for a doctrinal discrepancy related to his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-End-Rereading-Genesiss-Revelations/dp/1608999270">The Beginning and The End</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the book was already in manuscript form when he was hired by CU, meaning that he wrote this book before he even knew he’d be working at a place that would have loved to see a shout out to Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis somewhere, anywhere in the tome’s 106 pages. Furthermore, the hiring committee was made aware of Dr. Pahl’s forthcoming book, and he taught his sample lecture during the hiring process on Genesis and the creation accounts! But that wasn’t enough to save him from getting “reviewed” by an <em>ad hoc</em> panel and “released from his teaching duties.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, he’s remained on the school’s payroll this academic year, so that he and his family didn’t get sent back to Canada right away without work or housing. However, to the best of my knowledge, he is still looking for work.</p>

<p>What a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shameful way to treat a gracious and godly immigrant family.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="carl-rubyimg-decodingasync-classalignright-alt-srchttpwwwcedarvilleedumediaimagescampus-newsnews2012carl-ruby-13_001jpgw250-">Carl Ruby<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>As if the previous two concerns weren’t enough, the University quickly got rid of Carl Ruby, the Vice President for Student Life, this January. Not only have the Administration and Trustees neglected to justify this decision, they refuse to admit that they made the decision in the first place!!! According to the University PR statements, we’re to believe that Carl Ruby, after 25 years of service to his alma mater, randomly decided in January that now would be a great time to seek employment opportunities elsewhere. Apparently he also thought it would be great to leave his office just five days after his resignation was announced for him!</p>
<p>What’s the other option? Moral or legal failure, right? Well, Dr. Gredy (acting CU President) himself denied this at the <a href="http://cedars.cedarville.edu/article/585/SGA-Town-Hall-Meeting-Jan-22/">SGA Town Hall meeting last month</a>, saying that Ruby’s resignation was not due to a personal/moral failure.</p>
<p>What’s left, then? Well, despite my University’s urging to “not connect the dots” on these matters, the unavoidable conclusion is that <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr. Ruby was FIRED<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->and that CU Admins/Trustees are hesitant (and deceptively so) to admit that.</p>
